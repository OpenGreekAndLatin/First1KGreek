<title type="main">THE SECOND PART OF THE TREATISE ABOUT THE PLANTING OF NOAH.</title>
<div id="Section1" n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section1Sent1" n="1">In the former part of this treatise we have spoken of the art of husbandry as to its genus, dwelling on it at as great a length as the time admitted of; but in this book we will discuss the question of his cultivation of his vineyard with regard to the species as far as it is in our power.</s><s id="Section1Sent2" n="2">For Moses represents the just Noah not only as a husbandman, but also especially as occupied with the cultivation of vines, saying, "Noah began to be a husbandman of the earth; and he planted a vineyard."</s></div>
<div id="Section2" n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section2Sent1" n="1">And it is fitting that a man who was about to discuss the whole question of separate plants and manners of cultivation, should first of all acquire an accurate comprehension of the most perfect plants in the universe, and of the great planter and superintendent of them.</s><s id="Section2Sent2" n="2">He then who is the greatest of all planters and the most perfect in art, is the Ruler of the universe; and his plant is not one which comprises within itself only individual plants, but rather infinite numbers of them springing up like suckers from one root, namely, this world.</s></div>
<div id="Section3" n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section3Sent1" n="1">For after the Creator of the world, reducing that substance, which was in its own nature destitute of order and regularity, into a state of order, and bringing it from a condition of confusion into a distinct system, began to fashion and shape it, he placed the earth and the water in the middle, and the plants of air and fire he drew up from their previously central position to a lofty eminence; and the aether he arranged all round, placing it as a boundary to and preservation of the things within, from which also it seems that the heaven  derives its name, causing the earth to be borne upon the water in such a way that it continues dry, which, however, there was reason to fear might be dissolved by water; and this great worker of marvels, moreover, united the air, which was exceedingly</s><s id="Section3Sent2" n="2">cold by its own nature, to fire which is very hot; a most surprising miracle.</s></div>
<div id="Section4" n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section4Sent1" n="1">For how can it be looked upon as anything but a prodigy, for that which would dissolve another thing, to be held together by that which it would dissolve: that is to say, for water to be held together by earth; and again, for that which is the hottest of all things to be placed upon that which is the coldest without its nature being destroyed, that is to say, for fire to be placed upon air?</s><s id="Section4Sent2" n="2">And these are the elements of this most perfect plant; but the very great and all productive plant is this world, of which the aforesaid branches are the main shoots.</s></div>
<div id="Section5" n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section5Sent1" n="1">We must now therefore consider where God placed its foundations, and in fact, what foundation it has on which it is supported, as a statue is on a pedestal; certainly we cannot imagine that any body is left outside and wandering about, since God has worked up and arranged every imaginable material throughout the whole universe.</s></div>
<div id="Section6" n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section6Sent1" n="1">For it was fitting that the most perfect and greatest of all works should be made by the greatest of all makers; and it would not have been the most perfect of works if it had not been filled up by perfect parts, so that this world consists of all earth, and all water, and all air, and all fire, not a single particle, no not the smallest imaginable atom, being omitted.</s></div>
<div id="Section7" n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section7Sent1" n="1">It follows therefore of necessity, that what is outside must either be a vacuum or nothing at all.</s><s id="Section7Sent2" n="2">If now it is a vacuum, than how can that which is full and solid, and the heaviest of all things, avoid being pressed down by its own weight, since there is no solid thing to hold it up?</s><s id="Section7Sent3" n="3">from which consideration it would appear to be something like a vision, since the mind is always seeking for some corporeal foundation, such as everything which is moved, must of necessity have: and especially the world, inasmuch as it is the greatest of all bodies, and embraces a multitude of other bodies as its own appropriate parts.</s></div>
<div id="Section8" n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section8Sent1" n="1">If therefore any one wishes to escape from the difficulties of this question which present themselves in the different doubts thus raised, let him speak freely and say that there is nothing in any material of such power as to be able to support this weight of the world.</s><s id="Section8Sent2" n="2">But it is the eternal law of the everlasting God which is the most supporting and</s><s id="Section8Sent3" n="3">firm foundation of the universe.</s></div>
<div id="Section9" n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section9Sent1" n="1">This it is which, being extended from the centre to the borders, and again from the extremities to the centre, runs through the whole unsubdued course of nature, collecting all the parts and binding them firmly together; for the father who created them has made it the indissoluble bond of the universe.</s></div>
<div id="Section10" n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section10Sent1" n="1">Very naturally and appropriately therefore, all earth will not be dissolved by all water, which the bosom of the earth contains, nor will fire be extinguished by air, nor again will air be burnt up by fire, since the divine law establishes itself as a boundary to all these elements, like a vowel among consonants, so that the universe may, as it were, be harmonious in concert with the music expressed by letters; persuasion, by its own authority, putting an end to the threatening conflicts of contrary natures.</s></div>
<div id="Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section11Sent1" n="1">Thus then the plant which bears all things was rooted, and when it was rooted was made strong.</s><s id="Section11Sent2" n="2">But of the particular plants, and those of smaller growth, some were moveable, so as to have their places changed; and some were made so as, without any such change, to stand steadily in the same place.</s></div>
<div id="Section12" n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section12Sent1" n="1">Those then that are affected by motion, inducing change of place, which we call animals, are attached to the most important portions of the universe; the terrestrial animals to the earth, the animals which swim to the water, the winged animals to the air and those which can live in the flame to the fire (which last are said to be most evidently produced in Macedonia), and the stars are attached to the heaven.</s><s id="Section12Sent2" n="2">For those who have studied philosophy pronounce the stars also to be animals, being endowed with intellect and pervading the whole universe; some being planets, and moving by their own intrinsic nature; and others, that is the fixed stars, being borne along with the revolutions of the universe; so that they likewise appear to change their places.</s></div>
<div id="Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section13Sent1" n="1">But those which are regulated according to a nature devoid of all sensation, which are peculiarly called plants, have no participation in that motion which involves a change of place.</s></div>
<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">But the Creator made two different races on the earth and in the air.</s><s id="Section14Sent2" n="2">In the air, he made the winged animals capable of being perceived by the external senses, and other powers which can by no means be comprehended in any place</s><s id="Section14Sent3" n="3">by the external senses; and this is the company of incorporeal souls arranged in order, but not in the same classifications.</s><s id="Section14Sent4" n="4">For it is said that some are assigned to mortal bodies, and are again subjected to a change of place according to certain defined periodical revolutions; but that others which have received a more divinely prepared habitation, look down upon the region of the earth, and that in the highest place, near the other itself, the purest souls are placed, which those who have studied philosophy among the Greeks call heroes, but which Moses, by a felicitous appellation, entitles angels; souls which go as ambassadors and messengers of good from the ruler of all things to his subjects, and messengers also to the king respecting those things of which his subjects have heard.</s><s id="Section14Sent5" n="5">To the earth again he assigned two classes, terrestrial animals and plants, wishing that she should be at the same time their mother and their nurse.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">For, as in the case of woman and every animal of the female sex, fountains of milk spring up in them when they are about to bring forth, in order that they may supply the offspring that is born of them with necessary and suitable food; so in a similar manner God has assigned to the earth, which is the mother of all terrestrial animals, all the different species of plants, in order that the animals produced by the earth may have such food as is akin to them, and not alien from their natures.</s></div>
<div id="Section16" n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section16Sent1" n="1">And, indeed, God has caused plants to grow with their heads downwards, having fixed their heads in the deepest parts of the earth; and having drawn up the heads of the irrational animals from the earth, he has set them up high on long necks, putting their fore feet under their necks as a kind of foundation.</s></div>
<div id="Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section17Sent1" n="1">But man has received a preeminently superior formation.</s><s id="Section17Sent2" n="2">For of all other animals God has bent the eyes downwards, so that they look upon the ground; but on the other hand, he has raised the eyes of man so that he may behold the heaven, being not a terrestrial but a celestial plant as the old proverb is.</s></div>
<div id="Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section18Sent1" n="1">But the others who say that our mind is a portion of the ethereal nature, have by this assertion attributed to man a kindred with the air; but the great Moses has not named the species of the rational soul by a title resembling that of any created being, but has pronounced it an image of the divine and invisible being, making it a coin as it were of sterling metal, stamped and impressed with the seal of God, the impression of which is the eternal word.</s></div>
<div id="Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section19Sent1" n="1">For, says Moses, "God breathed into man’s face the breath of life,"  so that it follows of necessity, that he that received the breath must be fashioned after the model of him who sent it forth.</s><s id="Section19Sent2" n="2">On which account it is said too, that "Man was made after the image of God,"  and not after the image of any created being.</s></div>
<div id="Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section20Sent1" n="1">It follows, therefore, since the soul of man has been fashioned in accordance with the archetypal word of the great cause of all things, that his body also, having been raised up to the purest portion of the universe—the heaven, must extend its vision, in order that, by a comparison with what is visible, it may attain to an accurate comprehension of what is invisible.</s></div>
<div id="Section21" n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section21Sent1" n="1">Since, therefore, it was impossible for any one to perceive the attraction of the mind to the living God, except for those persons alone who were drawn towards him (for that which each person suffers, he alone particularly knows),</s><s id="Section21Sent2" n="2">God has given us the eyes of the body (as an evident and visible image of the invisible eye), which are able to look up to the heaven;</s></div>
<div id="Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section22Sent1" n="1">for when the eyes, composed of perishable material, have raised themselves to such a height, as to be able from the region of the earth to mount up to heaven which is removed at so great a distance from the earth, and to reach its utmost heights, how great a course in every direction must we suppose to be within the power of the eyes of the soul?</s><s id="Section22Sent2" n="2">which, being endowed with wings from their excessive desire to see the living God clearly, reach up not only to the highest regions of the air, but even pass over the boundaries of the whole world, and hasten towards the Uncreated.</s></div>
<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">On this account, those persons who are insatiable in their desire for wisdom and knowledge are said in the sacred oracles to be "called up."</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">For it is legitimate that those persons should be called up to the Deity who have been inspired by him.</s><s id="Section24Sent2" n="2">For it would be a terrible thing if whirlwinds and hurricanes have power to tear trees up by their roots, and to toss them in the air, and to carry off vessels of many tons’ burden, though loaded with cargoes, as if they were the lightest things imaginable, out of the middle of the sea; and if even lakes and rivers are raised on high, when their streams actually leave the bosom of the earth, having been drawn up by the ardent and diversified eddies of the winds: and yet, if the mind, which is intrinsically light, cannot be raised up by the nature of the Divine Spirit, which is able to do everything and to subdue all things below, and cannot be elevated to an exceeding height; and especially the mind of the man who studies philosophy in a genuine manner.</s></div>
<div id="Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section25Sent1" n="1">For he does not incline downwards to the things dear to the body and to the earth, from which he separates himself, and studies to alienate himself as far as possible; but he is borne upwards, being insatiably devoted to sublime, holy, magnificent, and happy natures.</s></div>
<div id="Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section26Sent1" n="1">Therefore, also, Moses will be summoned upwards, the steward and guardian of the sacred mysteries of the living God.</s><s id="Section26Sent2" n="2">For we read in the book of Leviticus, "He called Moses up to him."</s><s id="Section26Sent3" n="3">Bezeleel also will be summoned up, being thought worthy of the same honours.</s><s id="Section26Sent4" n="4">For him, also, God calls up for the preparation of the sacred furniture and for the care of the sacred works.</s></div>
<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">But he receives only the second honour of this summons, and the all-wise Moses shall have the first place assigned to him.</s><s id="Section27Sent2" n="2">For the former fashions shadows only, like painters do, in which it is not right to form any living thing.</s><s id="Section27Sent3" n="3">For the very name Bezeleel is interpreted to mean, "working in shadows."</s><s id="Section27Sent4" n="4">But Moses does not make shadows, but the task is assigned to him of forming the archetypal natures of things themselves.</s><s id="Section27Sent5" n="5">And in other places, also, the great Cause of all things is accustomed to reveal his secrets to some in a more conspicuous</s><s id="Section27Sent6" n="6">and visible manner, as if in the pure light of the sun, and to others more sparely, as though in the shade.</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">Having therefore gone through all the larger plants in the universe, let us see in what manner the all-wise God made the trees which exist in the smaller world, that is to say, in man.</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">In the first place, then, taking our body as if it were a field of deep soil, he created the external senses to be in it as so many channels.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">And after that, he arranged the place of each separate one of them, as if it had been a fruit-bearing and most useful tree, assigning the sense of hearing to the ear, that of sight to the eyes, that of smell to the nostrils, and each of the other senses and faculties to their kindred and appropriate organs.</s><s id="Section29Sent2" n="2">And the divine man bears his testimony to this account of mine, speaking thus in his Psalms, "He that planted the ear, doth he not hear?</s><s id="Section29Sent3" n="3">and he that made the eyes, shall he not see?"</s></div>
<div id="Section30" n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section30Sent1" n="1">Moreover, all the different powers which run down as far as the legs and hands, and all the other parts of the body, whether internal or external, are all those of an unimportant kind.</s></div>
<div id="Section31" n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section31Sent1" n="1">But those which are better and more perfect he has rooted in the more central portion; that which is preeminently able to bring forth fruit, the dominant portion of the man.</s><s id="Section31Sent2" n="2">These faculties are perception, comprehension, felicity of conjecture, study, memory, habit, disposition, the various species of art, the firmness of knowledge of different things, the apprehension of the speculations of universal virtue in such a way as is never forgotten.</s><s id="Section31Sent3" n="3">Now, no mortal is competent to plant any one of these things himself.</s><s id="Section31Sent4" n="4">But of all of them together there is one architect, the uncreated God, who has not only made them originally, but who also makes them for and implants them in every individual man that is born.</s></div>
<div id="Section32" n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section32Sent1" n="1">Now the account of the planting of Paradise is consistent with what has been already said.</s><s id="Section32Sent2" n="2">For it is stated, "God planted a Paradise in Eden, towards the east; and there he placed the man whom he has made."</s><s id="Section32Sent3" n="3">Now, to think that it is here meant that God planted vines, or olive trees, or apple trees, or pomegranates, or any trees of such kinds, is mere incurable folly.</s></div>
<div id="Section33" n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section33Sent1" n="1">For why should he have done so?</s><s id="Section33Sent2" n="2">any one may ask.</s><s id="Section33Sent3" n="3">Was it that he might have a pleasant abode to spend his time in?</s><s id="Section33Sent4" n="4">Even the whole world could not be considered a dwelling sufficient for God, the governor of the universe.</s><s id="Section33Sent5" n="5">Would it not appear to be deficient in innumerable other things, so that it could never be looked upon as a place worthily suited to the reception of the great King?</s><s id="Section33Sent6" n="6">True, indeed, it is impiety to think that the Cause of all things can be contained in that which he has caused, especially as even those trees do not invariably bear their annual fruit.</s></div>
<div id="Section34" n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section34Sent1" n="1">For whose enjoyment and use, then, is it that the Paradise is to produce fruit?</s><s id="Section34Sent2" n="2">For that of no man.</s><s id="Section34Sent3" n="3">For there is absolutely no one at all who is represented as inhabiting the Paradise, since Moses says that God removed the first man who was created out of the earth, by name Adam, from his original place, and placed him here.</s></div>
<div id="Section35" n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg010.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section35Sent1" n="1">And, moreover, God has no need of food any more than he has of anything else; for it follows necessarily that he who uses food must first of all stand in need of it.</s><s id="Section35Sent2" n="2">And in the second place, that he must have organs adapted for the reception of it, by means of which he can receive it when it enters him; and then dismiss it from him when he has digested it.</s><s id="Section35Sent3" n="3">But all these things, which are parts of the happiness and blessedness which surround the Great Cause of all things, are inconsistent with the doctrine of those men who represent him as clothed with human form, and influenced by human passions to the utter destruction of all piety and religious feeling—both great virtues; such notions being contrary to all law and right.</s></div>
