<div id="Book1Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section24Sent1" n="1">And this knowledge he derived also from the Egyptians, who  study mathematics above all things, and he learnt with great accuracy the state of that art among both the Chaldaeans and Egyptians, making himself acquainted with the points in which they agree with and differ from each other—making himself master of all their disputes without encouraging any disputatious disposition in himself—but seeking the plain truth, since his mind was unable to admit any falsehood, as those are accustomed to do who contend violently for one particular side of a question; and who advocate any doctrine which is set before them, whatever it may be, not inquiring whether it deserves to be supported, but acting in the same manner as those lawyers who defend a cause for pay, and are wholly indifferent to the justice of their cause.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section25Sent1" n="1">And when he had passed the boundaries of the age of</s><s id="Book1Section25Sent2" n="2">infancy he began to exercise his intellect; not, as some people do, letting his youthful passions roam at large without restraint, although in him they had ten thousand incentives by reason of the abundant means for the gratification of them which royal places supply; but he behaved with temperance and fortitude, as though he had bound them with reins, and thus he restrained their onward impetuosity by force.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section26Sent1" n="1">And he tamed, and appeased, and brought under due command every one of the other passions which are naturally and as far as they are themselves concerned frantic, and violent, and unmanageable.</s><s id="Book1Section26Sent2" n="2">And if any one of them at all excited itself and endeavoured to get free from restraint he administered severe punishment to it, reproving it with severity of language; and, in short, he repressed all the principal impulses and most violent affections of the soul, and kept guard over them as over a restive horse, fearing lest they might break all bounds and get beyond the power of reason which ought to be their guide to restrain them, and so throw everything everywhere into confusion.</s><s id="Book1Section26Sent3" n="3">For these passions are the causes of all good and of all evil; of good when they submit to the authority of dominant reason, and of evil when they break out of bounds and scorn all government and restraint.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section27Sent1" n="1">Very naturally, therefore, those who associated with him and every one who was acquainted with him marvelled at him, being astonished as at a novel spectacle, and inquiring what kind of mind it was that had its abode in his body, and that was set up in it like an image in a shrine; whether it was a human mind or a divine intellect, or something combined of the two; because he had nothing in him resembling the many, but had gone beyond them all and was elevated to a more sublime height.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section28Sent1" n="1">For he never provided his stomach with any luxuries beyond those necessary tributes which nature has appointed to be paid to it, and as to the pleasures of the organs below the stomach he paid no attention to them at all, except as far as the object of having legitimate children was concerned.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg022.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section29Sent1" n="1">And being in a most eminent degree a practiser of abstinence and self-denial, and being above all men inclined to ridicule a life of effeminacy and luxury (for he desired to live for his soul alone, and not for his body), he exhibited the doctrines of philosophy in all his daily actions, saying precisely what he thought, and performing such actions only as</s><s id="Book1Section29Sent2" n="2">were consistent with his words, so as to exhibit a perfect harmony between his language and his life, so that as his words were such also was his life, and as his life was such likewise was his language, like people who are playing together in tune on a musical instrument.</s></div>
