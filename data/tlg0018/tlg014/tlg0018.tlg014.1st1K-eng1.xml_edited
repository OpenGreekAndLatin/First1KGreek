<div id="Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg014.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section11Sent1" n="1">But if you choose to collect again those portions of yourself which you have lent away, and to invest yourself with the possession of yourself, without separating off or alienating any part of it, you will have a happy life, enjoying for ever and ever the fruit of good things which belong not to strangers but to yourself.</s></div>

<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg014.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">Very beautifully therefore has the sacred interpreter of God’s will entitled one entire holy volume of the giving of the</s><s id="Section14Sent2" n="2">law, the Exodus, having thus found out an appropriate name for the oracles contained therein.</s><s id="Section14Sent3" n="3">For being a man desirous of giving instruction and exceedingly ready to admonish and correct, he desires to remove the whole of the people of the soul as a multitude capable of receiving admonition and correction from the country of Egypt, that is to say, the body, and to take them out from among its inhabitants, thinking it a most terrible and grievous burden that the mind which is endowed with the faculty of sight should be oppressed by the pleasures of the flesh, and should obey whatever commands the relentless desires choose to impose upon it.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg014.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">Therefore, after the merciful God has instructed this people, groaning and bitterly weeping for the abundance of the things concerning the body, and the exceeding supply of external things (for it is said, "The children of Israel groaned by reason of the works")  when, God, I say, had instructed them about their going out, the prophet himself led them forth in safety.</s></div>
