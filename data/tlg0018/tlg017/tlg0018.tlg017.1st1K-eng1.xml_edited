<div id="Section2" n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section2Sent1" n="1">Having in our former treatise spoken what was becoming respecting the preliminary branches of education, and respecting affliction, we will now proceed in regular order to discuss the topic of fugitives.</s><s id="Section2Sent2" n="2">Now Moses often mentions persons who flee, as here he says concerning Hagar, that being afflicted she fled from the face of her mistress.</s></div>
<div id="Section3" n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section3Sent1" n="1">I think therefore that there are three causes for flight—hatred, fear, and shame.</s><s id="Section3Sent2" n="2">Now women leave their husbands out of hatred, and for the same reason men desert their wives.</s><s id="Section3Sent3" n="3">But children flee from their parents, and servants from their masters, out of fear.</s><s id="Section3Sent4" n="4">And lastly, friends avoid their companions out of shame, when</s><s id="Section3Sent5" n="5">they have done anything which is displeasing to them.</s><s id="Section3Sent6" n="6">And before now I have known instances of fathers who have led a life of effeminate luxury, reverencing the austere and philosophical lives of their sons, and out of shame preferring to live in the country rather than in the city.</s></div>
<div id="Section4" n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section4Sent1" n="1">Now of all these three causes, one may find instances revealed in the sacred scriptures.</s><s id="Section4Sent2" n="2">Accordingly, Jacob, the practiser of virtue, fled from his father-in-law Laban out of hatred, and from his brother Esau out of fear, as I shall show presently.</s></div>
<div id="Section5" n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section5Sent1" n="1">But Hagar flees out of shame.</s><s id="Section5Sent2" n="2">And a proof of this is, that the angel, that is the word of God, met her, with the intent to recommend her what she ought to do, and to guide her in her return to her mistress’s house.</s><s id="Section5Sent3" n="3">For he encouraged her, and said unto her: "The Lord has heard the cry of thy humiliation," which you uttered, not out of fear, nor yet out of hatred.</s><s id="Section5Sent4" n="4">For the one is the feeling of an ignoble soul, and the other of one which loves contention, but under the influence of that copy of temperance and modesty, shame.</s></div>
<div id="Section6" n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section6Sent1" n="1">For it was natural, if she had fled out of fear, that he would have encouraged her mistress, who was holding out threats to alarm her, to comfort her, and to restore her to tranquillity.</s><s id="Section6Sent2" n="2">For then it would have been safe for the fugitive to return, and not before.</s><s id="Section6Sent3" n="3">But no one intercedes for her to her mistress, inasmuch as she was already appeased by herself.</s><s id="Section6Sent4" n="4">But this angel, who is reproof, at the same time friendly and full of advice, out of his good-will teaches her not to feel only shame, but also to entertain confidence, for that modesty is but half a virtue, when separated from proper boldness.</s></div>
<div id="Section7" n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section7Sent1" n="1">Therefore the account which follows will show these characteristics more accurately.</s><s id="Section7Sent2" n="2">But we must return to the heads of the question which we have already set forth, and begin with those who flee under the influence of hatred.</s><s id="Section7Sent3" n="3">"For," says the scripture, "Jacob concealed his purpose from Laban the Syrian, so as not to tell him that he was fleeing, and he fled, he and all that he had."</s></div>
<div id="Section8" n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section8Sent1" n="1">What then was the cause of his hatred?</s><s id="Section8Sent2" n="2">For perhaps you are desirous to hear this.</s><s id="Section8Sent3" n="3">There are some persons who make to themselves gods of substance destitute of all distinctive quality, and species, and shape, neither knowing the cause which puts things in motion, nor showing any anxiety to learn of those who do know, but</s><s id="Section8Sent4" n="4">being contented with their ignorance and want of understanding of the most important kind of learning, which was in fact the first and only thing of which it was absolutely necessary to labour for the understanding.</s></div>
<div id="Section9" n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section9Sent1" n="1">Laban now is one of this kind of persons; for the sacred scriptures attribute to him a flock devoid of all distinctive marks.</s><s id="Section9Sent2" n="2">And matter, without any distinctive characteristics, is without any marks in the universe, and so is in men the soul, which is destitute of learning and which has no instructors.</s></div>
<div id="Section10" n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section10Sent1" n="1">But there are others who belong to a better portion, who say that the mind has come and arranged everything, bringing the disorder which arose from an ochlocracy among all existing things, into the order established by the legitimate authority of kingly power.</s><s id="Section10Sent2" n="2">Of this company Jacob is a follower, who presides over the marked and party-coloured flock.</s><s id="Section10Sent3" n="3">On the other hand the species in the universe is distinguished by marks and is of varied colour, and so also in men is the mind which has been well instructed and which is fond of learning.</s></div>
<div id="Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section11Sent1" n="1">And he who is marked, and who is the companion of true kingly power, having received a great deal of the social affection from nature, goes to him who has no distinguishing marks, and who, as I have said, makes himself gods of the material powers, and who thinks that besides them there is no effectual cause of anything, to teach him that his opinions are not correct.</s></div>
<div id="Section12" n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section12Sent1" n="1">For the world has been created, and has by all means derived its existence from some extraneous cause.</s><s id="Section12Sent2" n="2">But the word itself of the Creator is the seal by which each of existing things is invested with form.</s><s id="Section12Sent3" n="3">In accordance with which fact perfect species also does from the very beginning follow things when created, as being an impression and image of the perfect word.</s></div>
<div id="Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section13Sent1" n="1">For the animal when first created is imperfect as to quantity; and a proof of this is the gradual growth which takes place at each successive age.</s><s id="Section13Sent2" n="2">But it is perfect as to quality.</s><s id="Section13Sent3" n="3">For the same quality remains in it, as having been stamped upon it by the divine word which abides permanently and never charges.</s></div>
<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">But seeing that he is dumb with respect to learning and to all desirable and legitimate authority, he very naturally thinks of flight.</s><s id="Section14Sent2" n="2">For he is afraid that in addition to not being able to derive any advantage, he may even be injured.</s><s id="Section14Sent3" n="3">For all connections with the foolish injures us, and very often the soul</s><s id="Section14Sent4" n="4">against its will becomes stamped with the impression of their insanity of mind.</s><s id="Section14Sent5" n="5">And, in truth, instruction is naturally a thing inimical to ignorance, and so is industry to indifference.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">In reference to which fact the powers devoted to practise and meditation, when they are set free, cry out, giving a full account of the causes of their hatred: "Have we not any longer a share and an inheritance in the house of our father?</s><s id="Section15Sent2" n="2">Are we not now accounted aliens by him?</s><s id="Section15Sent3" n="3">For he has sold us, and he has eaten up and devoured our money.</s><s id="Section15Sent4" n="4">All the wealth and all the glory which God took from our father shall belong to us and to our children."</s></div>
<div id="Section16" n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section16Sent1" n="1">For those who are free both in name and also in their minds do not consider any foolish person as either rich or glorious, but look upon all such persons, so to say, as inglorious and poor, even if they exceed the fortune of wealthy kings.</s><s id="Section16Sent2" n="2">For they do not say that they will have the riches of their father, but the riches which have been taken away; nor do they say that they shall possess his glory, but the glory which has been taken away from him.</s></div>
<div id="Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section17Sent1" n="1">But the wicked man is deprived of all genuine riches and of all true and honourable glory; for these blessings are procured by wisdom, and temperance, and the kindred dispositions of the soul, and are inherited by those souls which love virtue.</s></div>
<div id="Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section18Sent1" n="1">Therefore, it is not the things which belong to the wicked man, but those of which he is destitute, that are the abundance and the glory of the good.</s><s id="Section18Sent2" n="2">And he is destitute of virtues which are their possession, in order that what is said in another place may be consistent with the passage already quoted: "Let us sacrifice the abominations of Egypt to the Lord our God."</s><s id="Section18Sent3" n="3">For the virtues are perfect and blameless offerings, and so are the actions in accordance with virtue, which the Egyptian body, being devoted to the passions, abominates;</s></div>
<div id="Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section19Sent1" n="1">for, as in this passage, those things which, according to the principles of natural philosophy, are reckoned profane among the Egyptians are called sacred by the Israelites who see acutely, and are all offered as sacrifices; so, in the same manner, the man who is the companion of virtue will be the heir of those things of which every foolish man is deprived and destitute.</s><s id="Section19Sent2" n="2">And these things are true glory, which in fact differs in no</s><s id="Section19Sent3" n="3">respect from knowledge, and wealth, not blind wealth, but that which is the most sharp-sighted of all existing things, which never receives any base money, not even anything whatever devoid of life unless it be thoroughly tried and approved.</s></div>
<div id="Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section20Sent1" n="1">Very naturally, therefore, that person will flee from him who has no participation in divine blessings, who even in the matters in which he accuses another does without perceiving it accuse himself also, when he says, "If thou hadst told me I would have sent thee away."</s><s id="Section20Sent2" n="2">For this very thing was a worthy cause for your being deserted, if you, being the servant of an infinite number of masters, pretending to have been invested with command and authority, proclaimed liberty to others.</s></div>
<div id="Section21" n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section21Sent1" n="1">But I, says he, did not take a man as my assistant in the road which leads to virtue, but I listened to the divine oracles which enjoined me to depart from hence, and which even now continues to direct my course.</s></div>
<div id="Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section22Sent1" n="1">And how would you have sent me away?</s><s id="Section22Sent2" n="2">surely, as you boast, using pompous language, with a joy which to me would have been sorrowful, with music which would have been no music, with dances, and noises destitute of articulate sound and of reason, striking blows on the soul through the medium of the ears, and with the harp, and with sounds unsuited to the lyre, and unsuited to harmony, not being so much organs, as the actions of a whole life.</s><s id="Section22Sent3" n="3">But these are the things by reason of which I meditated flight; but you, as it seems, contemplated dragging me back from my flight, in order that I might return on account of the deceitful and seductive nature of the external senses, by which I was scarcely able to permit myself to be carried forward.</s></div>
<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">Hatred then, was the cause of the flight which I have been here describing; but fear was the cause of the one which I am about to mention.</s><s id="Section23Sent2" n="2">For, says the sacred historian, Rebekkah said unto Jacob, "Behold, Esau thy brother threateneth to kill thee: now therefore, my son, hear my voice, and rise up, and flee to Laban my brother, to Charran, and dwell with him certain days, until the anger of thy brother is turned away, and he forget what thou hast done unto him; and then I will send again, and fetch thee back from thence."</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">For it was worth while to fear, lest the worse portion of the soul, lying in an ambuscade, or else moving forwards openly to the attack, might overthrow and cast down the better part; and so</s><s id="Section24Sent2" n="2">the counsel of the right-minded perseverance, Rebekkah, was very good.</s></div>
<div id="Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section25Sent1" n="1">But she says, when you see the bad man coming in with great impetuosity, against virtue, and making great account of those things which it is more proper to disregard, such as wealth, glory, and pleasure, and praising the performance of actions of injustice, as being the cause of all the advantages before mentioned: for we see that those who act unjustly, are, for the most part, men possessed of much silver, and of much gold, and of high reputation.</s><s id="Section25Sent2" n="2">Do not then, turn away to the opposite road, and devote yourself to a life of penury, and abasement, and austerity, and solitude; for, by so doing, you will irritate your adversary, and arm a more bitter enemy against yourself.</s></div>
<div id="Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section26Sent1" n="1">Consider, therefore, now by what conduct you may avoid his attacks; apply yourself to the same things, I do not mean the same pursuits, but to the same things which are the efficient causes of those things which have been mentioned; to honours, to offices of authority, to silver, to gold, to possessions, to money, to colours, to forms, to exceeding nicety; and when you meet with such things, then, like a skilful workman, impress the most beautiful appearance on the material substances: and perfect a most excellent work.</s></div>
<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">Do you not know, that if a man unacquainted with navigation, takes the management of a ship, which might otherwise have reached the harbour in safety, he overturns it?</s><s id="Section27Sent2" n="2">but that a man, skilful as a pilot, has often saved a ship which otherwise must have been lost?</s><s id="Section27Sent3" n="3">And also, some sick persons, owing to the unskilfulness of their medical attendants, have been severely afflicted with disease; while others, through the skill of their doctors, have escaped from dangerous sicknesses?</s><s id="Section27Sent4" n="4">And why need I have been prolix on this point; for always the things which are done with skill, are a conviction of those which are done unskilfully; and the true praise of the one is an unerring accusation of the other.</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">If therefore, you wish to convict a wicked man, who is also possessed of great wealth, do not disdain an abundance of money; for the unhappy man will soon show himself in his true colours, either as an illiberal and slavish-minded skin-flint, and parer of people by usury, or else as a profligate and intemperate spendthrift, very ready to devour and to squander, and a most zealous companion of harlots and brothel-keepers,</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">and pimps, and of every kind of profligate company.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">But you will rather bestow your contributions on those who are in want of friends, and will do favours to, and bestow your liberality on, your country, and will assist to portion out the daughters of needy parents, giving them, in addition to their inheritance, a most sufficient dowry; and in fact, very nearly throwing all your own property into the common stock, you will invite to a participation in it all who are worthy of favour.</s></div>
<div id="Section30" n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section30Sent1" n="1">And, in the same manner, when you wish to reprove any wicked man who is mad with a high opinion of himself and full of boasting, while you are able yourself to attain to distinguished honours, do not disdainfully reject the praise of the multitude: for by so doing you will trip up and supplant the miserable man who takes long strides, and who gives himself airs.</s><s id="Section30Sent2" n="2">For he will abuse his own renown for the purpose of behaving with insolence and contumely to others who are better than he, promoting those who are worse, so as to set them above them; while you, on the contrary, will give all worthy persons a share in your renown, giving in this manner security to those who are good, and by your admonitions improving those who are not so good.</s></div>
<div id="Section31" n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section31Sent1" n="1">And if you ever go to a drinking party or to a costly entertainment, go with a good confidence; for you will put to shame the intemperate man by your own dexterity.</s><s id="Section31Sent2" n="2">For he, falling on his belly, and opening his insatiable desires even before he opens his mouth, will glut himself in a most shameless and indecorous manner, and will seize the things belonging to his neighbour, and will lick up everything without thinking.</s><s id="Section31Sent3" n="3">And when he is completely sated with eating, then drinking, as the poets say, with his mouth open, he will make himself an object for the laughter and ridicule of all those who behold him.</s></div>
<div id="Section32" n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section32Sent1" n="1">But do you adopt a moderate course without being compelled thereto, and if ever you are constrained to indulge yourself in things beyond moderation, still make reason the governor of the necessity, and never go so far as to change pleasure into unpleasantness, but, if we may speak in such a manner, be drunk in a sober manner.</s></div>
<div id="Section33" n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg017.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section33Sent1" n="1">And here therefore truth may not unreasonably blame those who, without any examination, abandon the business and means of regulating a civil life, and who say that they have learnt to despise glory and pleasure; for those men are</s><s id="Section33Sent2" n="2">behaving insolently, and do not really despise these things, making an open boast of their sordid, and melancholy, and stern appearance, and putting forth their austere and dirty way of living as a bait, as if they were lovers of orderly behaviour, and modesty, and endurance;</s></div>
