<div id="Section7" n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section7Sent1" n="1">Unless, indeed, we ought to class his correction among his beneficent powers, not only because such a display is a portion of his laws and ordinances (for law is made up of two things, the honour of the good, and the chastisement of the wicked), but also because punishment reproves, and very often even corrects, and ameliorates those who have done wrong; and if it fails to do so with respect to them, at all events it does so to those who are near the offenders thus punished; for the punishment of others makes most men better, for fear lest they themselves should suffer the same things.</s></div>

<div id="Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section13Sent1" n="1">On this occasion the rich were not better off than the poor, nor the men of high rank than the lowly, nor the creditors than the debtors, nor the masters than the slaves, since the occasion gave equal privileges and communities to all men, so that the age of Saturn, which is so celebrated by the poets</s><s id="Section13Sent2" n="2">was no longer looked upon as a fiction and a fable,  on account of the universal prosperity and happiness which reigned every where, and the absence of all grief and fear, and the daily and nightly exhibitions of joy and festivity throughout every house and throughout the whole people, which lasted continually without any interruption during the first seven months of his reign.</s></div>
<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">But in the eighth month a severe disease attacked Caius who had changed the manner of his living which was a little while before, while Tiberius was alive, very simple and on that account more wholesome than one of great sumptuousness and luxury; for he began to indulge in abundance of strong wine and eating of rich dishes, and in the abundant license of insatiable desires and great insolence, and in the unseasonable use of hot baths, and emetics, and then again in wine-bibbing and drunkenness, and returning gluttony, and in lust after boys and women, and in everything else which tends to destroy both soul and body, and all the bonds which unite and strengthen the two; for the rewards of temperance are health and strength, and the wages of intemperance are weakness and disease which bring a man near to death.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">Accordingly, when the news was spread abroad that he was sick while the weather was still suitable for navigation (for it was the beginning of the autumn, which is the last season during which nautical men can safely take voyages, and during which in consequence they all return from the foreign marts in every quarter to their own native ports and harbours of refuge, especially all who exercise a prudent care not to be compelled to pass the winter in a foreign country); they, forsaking their former life of delicateness and luxury, now wore mournful faces, and every house and every city became full of depression and melancholy, their grief being now equal to and counterbalancing the joy which they experienced a short time before.</s></div>

<div id="Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section17Sent1" n="1">for men began to remember how numerous and how great are the evils which spring from anarchy, famine, and war, and the destruction of trees, and devastations, and deprivation of lands, and plundering of money, and the intolerable fear of slavery and death, which no one can relieve, all which evils appeared to admit of but one remedy, namely the recovery of Caius.</s></div>
<div id="Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section18Sent1" n="1">Accordingly when his disease began to abate, in a very short time even the men who were living on the very confines of the empire heard of it and rejoiced, for nothing is swifter than report,  and immediately every city was full of suspense and expectation, being continually eager for better news, until at length his perfect recovery was announced by fresh arrivals, at which news they again returned to their original cheerfulness, each thinking the health of Caius to be his own salvation;</s></div>

<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">for he put to death his cousin who had been left as the partner of his kingdom, and who was in fact a more natural successor to it than he himself; for he himself was only Tiberius’s grandson by adoption, but the other was so by blood; arguing as a pretext that he had detected him in plotting against him, though his very age was a sufficient refutation of any such accusation; for the unhappy victim was only just emerging from boyhood, and beginning to rank among the youths.</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">And, as s say, if Tiberius had lived a short time longer, Caius would have been made away with, as he began to be looked upon by him with unalterable suspicion, and the genuine grandson of Tiberius would have been named the future emperor, and the inheritor of his paternal kingdom.</s></div>

<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">since what can be a more desirable blessing for me than that my one mind and one body shall not be loaded with so great a weight of the cares of government, but for me to have some one who may be able to lighten and alleviate them by sharing them?</s><s id="Section27Sent2" n="2">I, therefore," said he: "passing over and being superior to all tutors, and masters, and guardians, register myself as his father, and him as my son."</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">With these words he deceived both those who were</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">present and the youth himself; for his proposal was a mere bait, his intention being not to invest him with the power which he expected, but to deprive him of even that which he already had, according to the law affecting co-heirs and partners; and accordingly now he plotted against him with absolute fearlessness, having no regard for nor fear of any one; for by the laws of the Romans the most complete and absolute authority over the son belongs to the father, besides the fact of Caius having the imperial authority which was wholly irresponsible, since no one could either venture or had any power to demand an account from him of any thing whatever that he might do.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">Accordingly, looking upon this youth to be like a thirds-man in the games, he proceeded to overthrow him, feeling no compassion, either for the fact of his having been brought up with him, or his being so nearly related to him, or for his age, but having no idea of sparing this miserable youth, doomed to an early death; his own partner in the government, his co-heir, who had formerly been expected to be all but the absolute emperor, by reason of his being the nearest relation to Tiberius; for when their fathers are dead, the grandsons are usually looked upon by their grandfathers as standing in the position of sons.</s></div>
<div id="Section30" n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section30Sent1" n="1">It is said moreover, that this youth, being ordered to slay himself with his own hands, while a centurion and a captain of a thousand were standing by (who had been expressly commanded to take no part in the horrid deed, since it was not lawful for the descendants of the emperors to be put to death by any one else; for Caius remembered the laws amid his lawless acts, and had some regard for piety in all his impious deeds, imitating as well as he could the nature of truth); he, not knowing how to kill himself, for he had never seen any one else put to death, and had never had any practise in fighting with weapons, which is the usual exercise and course of instruction for children who are being educated with a view to become leaders and rulers, on account of the wars which they may have to conduct, at first exhorted those officers who had come to him to put him to death themselves, stretching out his neck;</s></div>
<div id="Section31" n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section31Sent1" n="1">but when they did not dare to do so, he himself taking the sword inquired in his ignorance and want of experience what was the most mortal place, in order that by</s><s id="Section31Sent2" n="2">a well-directed blow he might cut short his miserable life; and they, like instructors in misery, led him on his way, and pointed out to him the part into which he was to thrust his sword; and he, having thus learnt his first and last lesson, became himself, miserable that he was, his own murderer under compulsion.</s></div>
<div id="Section32" n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section32Sent1" n="1">But when this first and greatest undertaking had been accomplished by Caius, there being no longer left any one who had any connexion with the supreme authority, to whom any one who bore him ill-will, and who was suspected by him, could possibly turn his eyes; he now, in the second place, proceeded to compass the death of Macro, a man who had co-operated with him in every thing relating to the empire, not only after he had been appointed emperor, for it is a characteristic of flattery to court those who are in a state of prosperity, but who had previously assisted him in his measures for securing that authority.</s></div>
<div id="Section33" n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section33Sent1" n="1">For Tiberius, who was a man of very profound prudence, and the most able of all the men of his court at perceiving the hidden intentions of any man, and who was as preeminent in intelligence and acuteness as he was in good fortune, did very often look with suspicion upon Caius as being evil disposed towards all the house of Claudius, and as being related to him only on the mother’s side,  and he feared for his grandson, lest he, being left a mere child, should be put to death by him.</s></div>
<div id="Section34" n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section34Sent1" n="1">And he judged him, moreover, very little fitted for an authority of such magnitude, both on account of the unsociableness and ferocity of his nature, and the inequality of his temper; for he was continually giving way to the most frantic and most inconsistent moods, not preserving any consistency either in his words or in his actions;</s></div>
<div id="Section35" n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section35Sent1" n="1">all which Macro studied with all his strength at every opportunity, pacifying the suspicions of Tiberius and all the prejudices with which he perceived that his mind was inflamed against Caius by reason of his ceaseless fear and anxiety for his grandson.</s></div>
<div id="Section36" n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg031.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section36Sent1" n="1">For he represented to him, that Caius was a person of a good and obedient disposition, and one who entertained the greatest affection for his cousin, so that out of his exceeding regard for him he would be willing even to abandon the government and to yield it up to him by himself, but that</s><s id="Section36Sent2" n="2">excessive modesty was anything but advantageous to many persons, in consequence of which Caius, who was of a most guileless and single-minded disposition, was looked upon by many as crafty and designing.</s></div>
