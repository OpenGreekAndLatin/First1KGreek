        A TREATISE TO PROVE THAT EVERY MAN WHO IS VIRTUOUS IS ALSO FREE.
<div id="Section1" n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section1Sent1" n="1">My former treatise, O Theodotus, was intended to prove that every wicked man was a slave, and that proposition I fully established by many natural and unquestionable arguments; and this other treatise is akin to that one, being its full brother both by the father’s and the mother’s side, and being even, in some sort, a twin with it, since in it we will proceed to show that every virtuous man is free.</s></div>
<div id="Section2" n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section2Sent1" n="1">Now it is said, that the most sacred sect of the Pythagoreans,</s><s id="Section2Sent2" n="2">among many other excellent doctrines, taught this one also, that it was not well to proceed by the plain ordinary roads, not meaning to urge us to walk among precipices (for it was not their object to weary our feet with labour), but intimating, by a figurative mode of speech, that we ought not, either in respect of our words or actions, to use only such as are ordinary and unchanged;</s></div>
<div id="Section3" n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section3Sent1" n="1">and all men who have studied philosophy in a genuine spirit, showing themselves obedient to this injunction, have looked upon it as a sentence, or rather as a law of equal weight with a divine oracle; and, departing from the common opinions of men, they have cut out for themselves a new and hitherto untravelled path, inaccessible to such as have no experience of wise maxims and doctrines, building up systems of ideas, which no one who is not pure either may or can handle.</s></div>
<div id="Section4" n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section4Sent1" n="1">Now when I speak of men not being pure, I mean those who have either been utterly destitute of education, or else who have tasted of it obliquely, and not in a straight-forward manner, changing the stamp of the beauty of wisdom so as to give an impression of the unsightliness of sophistry.</s></div>
<div id="Section5" n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section5Sent1" n="1">These men, not being able to discern that light which is appreciable only by the intellect, by reason of the weakness of the eyes of their soul, which are by nature easily dazzled by too much brightness, like men living in night and darkness, do not believe those who live in the light of day, and regard everything which they speak of as having seen them most distinctly through the beams of the sun shining powerfully upon them, as prodigious pictures, like so many visions or dreams, in no respect different from the exhibitions of jugglers;</s></div>

<div id="Section10" n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section10Sent1" n="1">Moreover, those who speak thus have, in obedience to the same dream, ventured to speak of slavery as the real condition of men of the greatest importance and genuine nobility of birth, men who can refer not only to their immediate parents, but to their grandfathers and remote ancestors up to the very first founders of their race, as having been in the highest esteem both among men and women; while, on the other hand, they speak of men, whose last three generations have been branded as slaves, born of slaves, who have never been anything but slaves, as free.</s></div>
<div id="Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section11Sent1" n="1">But all these things are, as I have said before, the inventions of men whose intellects are obscured, and who are slaves to opinions utterly under the influence of the outward senses, whose judgment is continually corrupted by those who are brought before its tribunal, and as such is unstable.</s></div>
<div id="Section12" n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section12Sent1" n="1">But they ought, if they had really been at all anxious for the truth, not to show themselves, in respect of their minds, inferior to those who have been diseased in their bodies; for such invalids,</s><s id="Section12Sent2" n="2">out of their desire for good health, commit themselves to the physicians.</s><s id="Section12Sent3" n="3">But these other men hesitate to get rid of that disease of the soul, ignorance, by becoming the associates of wise men; from whom they might not only learn to escape ignorance, but they might also acquire that peculiar possession of man, namely, knowledge.</s></div>
<div id="Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section13Sent1" n="1">And since, as that sweetest of all writers, Plato, says, envy is removed far from the divine company, but wisdom, that most divine and communicative of all things, never closes its school, but is continually open to receive all who thirst for salutary doctrines, to whom she pours forth the inexhaustible stream of unalloyed instruction and wisdom, and persuades them to yield to the intoxication of the soberest of all drunkenness.</s></div>
<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">And her disciples, like persons who have been initiated into the sacred and holy mysteries, when they are at last entirely filled with the knowledge proffered to them, reproach themselves bitterly for their previous neglect, as not having taken proper care of their time, but having lived a life which was hardly deserving to be called life, in which they have been utterly destitute of wisdom.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">Those men, therefore, act worthily who, in every case and everywhere, have resolved to dedicate the whole of their youth as the first fruits of their earliest vigour to nothing in preference to education, in which it is well for a man to spend both his youth and his age; for as they say that vessels even when empty do nevertheless retain the odour of whatever was originally poured into them,  so also are the souls of the young deeply impressed with the indelible character of those conceptions which were the first to be offered to their minds, which cannot be at all washed away by the torrent of any ideas which flow over the mind afterwards, but they to the last show the character originally given to them.</s><s id="Section15Sent2" n="2">However, we have said enough of these matters.</s></div>
<div id="Section16" n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section16Sent1" n="1">We must now examine with accuracy that which we have taken as the subject of our investigation, that we may not be led astray through being deceived by the indistinctness of words and expressions; but that, understanding accurately what it is of which we are speaking, we may frame our determinations felicitously.</s></div>
<div id="Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section17Sent1" n="1">Slavery, then, is of two kinds; slavery of the soul and slavery of the body.</s><s id="Section17Sent2" n="2">Now, of our bodies, men are masters; but over our souls, wickedness and the passions have the dominion.</s><s id="Section17Sent3" n="3">And we may speak of freedom in the same manner.</s><s id="Section17Sent4" n="4">For one kind of freedom gives fearlessness of body in respect of any dangers which can come upon it from men of still more powerful body; while the other produces peace to the mind, by putting a check upon the authority of the passions.</s></div>
<div id="Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section18Sent1" n="1">Now, about the former kind, scarcely any one ever raises any question; for the chances of fortune which happen to men are infinite in number, and it often happens that men of the highest virtue have fallen into unexpected misfortunes, and so have lost the freedom which belonged to them through their birth.</s><s id="Section18Sent2" n="2">But there is room for inquiry about those manners which neither desires, nor fears, nor pleasures, nor pains, have ever brought under the yoke, as if they had come forth out of confinement, and as if the chains by which they had been bound were now loosened.</s></div>
<div id="Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section19Sent1" n="1">Therefore, discarding all mention of those kinds of freedom which are only a pretence, and of all those names also which are quite unconnected with nature, but which owe their existence only to opinion, such as slaves born in the house, slaves purchased with money, slaves taken in war, let us now investigate the character of the man who is truly free, who is alone possessed of independence, even if ten thousand men set themselves down as his masters; for he will quote that line of Sophocles, which differs in no respect from the doctrines of the Pythagoreans—</s><s id="Section19Sent2" n="2">"God is my ruler, and no mortal man."</s></div>
<div id="Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section20Sent1" n="1">For, in real truth, that man alone is free who has God for his leader; indeed, in my opinion, that man is even the ruler of all others, and has all the affairs of the earth committed to him, being, as it were, the viceroy of a great king, the mortal lieutenant of an immortal sovereign.</s><s id="Section20Sent2" n="2">However, this assertion of the actual authority of the wise man may be postponed to a more suitable opportunity.</s><s id="Section20Sent3" n="3">We must at present examine minutely the question of his perfect freedom.</s></div>

<div id="Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section22Sent1" n="1">For he has learnt to disregard all the commands which those most unlawful masters of the soul seek to impose upon him, out of his admiration and desire for freedom, of which independence and spontaneousness of action are the most especial and inalienable inheritance; and by some persons the poet is praised who composed this iambic—</s><s id="Section22Sent2" n="2">"No man’s a slave who does not fear to die,"</s><s id="Section22Sent3" n="3">as having had an accurate idea of the consequences of such courage; for he conceived that nothing is so calculated to enslave the mind as a fear of death, arising from an excessive desire of living.</s></div>
<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">But we must consider that not only is the man who feels no anxiety to avoid death incapable of being made a slave, but the same privilege belongs to those who are indifferent to poverty, and want of reputation, and pain, and all those other things which the generality of men look upon as evils, being themselves but evil judges of things, since they pronounce a man a slave from a computation of what things he has need of, looking at the duties which he is compelled to perform, when they ought to look rather at his free and indomitable disposition;</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">for the man who out of a lowly and slavish spirit submits himself to lowly and slavish actions in spite of his deliberate judgment, is really and truly a slave; but he who adapts his circumstances and actions to the present occasion, and who voluntarily and in an enduring spirit bears up against the events of fortune, not looking at any thing of human affairs as extraordinary, but having by diligent consideration fully assured himself that all divine things are honoured by eternal order and happiness; and that all mortal things are tossed about in an everlasting storm and</s><s id="Section24Sent2" n="2">fluctuation of affairs so as to be subject to the greatest variety of changes and vicissitudes, and who, from those considerations, bears all that can befall him with a noble courage, is at once both a philosopher and a free man.</s></div>

<div id="Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section26Sent1" n="1">I have before now seen among the competitors in the pancratium, at the public games, one man inflicting all kinds of blows both with his hands and feet, all of them with great accuracy of aim and omitting nothing which could conduce to victory, and yet after a time fainting and desponding, and at last quitting the arena without the crown of victory; and the other who has received all his blows, being thoroughly hardened with great firmness of flesh, and being tough and unyielding, and filled with the true spirit of an athlete, and invigorated throughout his whole body, being like so much iron or stone, not at all yielding to the blows inflicted by the other, at last, by the endurance and resolution of his spirit, defeating the power of his adversary so as to obtain a complete victory.</s></div>
<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">And the condition of the virtuous man appears to me very much to resemble that of this person.</s><s id="Section27Sent2" n="2">For having thoroughly fortified his soul with strong and powerful reasoning, he so compels the man who is offering him violence to desist from weariness, before he himself can be compelled to do any thing contrary to his opinion of propriety.</s><s id="Section27Sent3" n="3">But perhaps this is incredible to those who do not know by experience that virtue is of the character that I have mentioned, just as that other case would be to those who have never seen the combatants in the pancratium; but nevertheless it is strictly true.</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">And it was from a regard to this fact that Antisthenes said that "the virtuous man was a burden hard to be borne."</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">For as folly is a light thing easily tossed about in every direction, so, on the contrary, wisdom is a well established and immovable thing of a weight which is not easily agitated.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg027.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">Accordingly the lawgiver of the Jews  represents the hands of the wise man as heavy, intimating by this figurative expression the gravity of his actions, which are supported in no superficial but in a solid manner by his inflexible mind.</s></div>
