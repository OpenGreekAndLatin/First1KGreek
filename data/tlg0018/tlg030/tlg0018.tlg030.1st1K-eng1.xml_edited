<div id="Section1" n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section1Sent1" n="1">Flaccus Avillius succeeded Sejanus in his hatred of and hostile designs against the Jewish nation.</s><s id="Section1Sent2" n="2">He was not, indeed, able to injure the whole people by open and direct means as he had been, inasmuch as he had less power for such a purpose, but he inflicted the most intolerable evils on all who came within his reach.</s><s id="Section1Sent3" n="3">Moreover, though in appearance he only attacked a portion of the nation, in point of fact he directed his aims against all whom he could find anywhere, proceeding more by art than by force; for those men who, though of tyrannical natures and dispositions, have not strength enough to accomplish their designs openly, seek to compass them by manoeuvres.</s></div>
<div id="Section2" n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section2Sent1" n="1">This Flaccus being chosen by Tiberius Caesar as one of his intimate companions, after the death of Severus, who had been lieutenant-governor in Egypt, was appointed viceroy of Alexandria and the country round about, being a man who at the beginning, as far as appearance went, had given innumerable instances of his excellence, for he was a man of prudence and diligence, and great acuteness of perception, very energetic in executing what he had determined on, very eloquent as a speaker, and skilful too at discerning what was suppressed as</s><s id="Section2Sent2" n="2">well as at understanding what was said.</s></div>
<div id="Section3" n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section3Sent1" n="1">Accordingly in a short time he became perfectly acquainted with the affairs of Egypt, and they are of a very various and diversified character, so that they are not easily comprehended even by those who from their earliest infancy have made them their study.</s><s id="Section3Sent2" n="2">The scribes were a superfluous body when he had made such advances towards the knowledge of all things, whether important or trivial, by his extended experience, that he not only surpassed them, but from his great accuracy was qualified instead of a pupil to become the instructor of those who had hitherto been the teachers of all other persons.</s></div>
<div id="Section4" n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section4Sent1" n="1">However, all those things in which he displayed an admirable system and great wisdom concerning the accounts and the general arrangement of the revenues of the land, though they were serious matters and of the last importance, were nevertheless not such as gave any proofs of a soul fit for the task of governing; but those things which exhibited a more brilliant and royal disposition he also displayed with great freedom.</s><s id="Section4Sent2" n="2">For instance, he bore himself with considerable dignity, and pride and pomp are advantageous things for a ruler; and he decided all suits of importance in conjunction with the magistrates, he pulled down the overproud, he forbade promiscuous mobs of men from all quarters to assemble together, and prohibited all associations and meetings which were continually feasting together under pretence of sacrifices, making a drunken mockery of public business, treating with great vigour and severity all who resisted his commands.</s></div>
<div id="Section5" n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section5Sent1" n="1">Then when he had filled the whole city and country with his wise legislation, he proceeded in turn to regulate the military affairs of the land, issuing commands, arranging matters, training the troops of every kind, infantry, cavalry, and light-armed, teaching the commanders not to deprive the soldiers of their pay, and so drive them to acts of piracy and rapine, and teaching each individual soldier not to proceed to any actions unauthorised by his military service, remembering that he was appointed with the especial object of preserving peace.</s></div>
<div id="Section6" n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section6Sent1" n="1">Perhaps some one may say here: "Do you then, my good man, you who have determined to accuse this man, bring no accusation whatever against him, but on the contrary, weave long panegyrics in his honour?</s><s id="Section6Sent2" n="2">Are you not doting and mad?"</s><s id="Section6Sent3" n="3">"I am not mad, my friend, nor am I a downright fool, so as</s><s id="Section6Sent4" n="4">to be unable to see the consequences or connexion of things.</s></div>
<div id="Section7" n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section7Sent1" n="1">I praise Flaccus, not because it is right to praise an enemy, but in order to make his wickedness more conspicuous; for pardon is given to a man who does wrong from ignorance of what is right; but he who does wrong knowingly has no excuse, being already condemned by the tribunal of his own conscience."</s></div>
<div id="Section8" n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section8Sent1" n="1">For having received a government which was intended to last six years, for the first five years, while Tiberius Caesar was alive, he both preserved peace and also governed the country generally with such vigour and energy that he was superior to all the governors who had gone before him.</s></div>
<div id="Section9" n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section9Sent1" n="1">But in the last year, after Tiberius was dead, and when Caius had succeeded him as emperor, he began to relax in and to be indifferent about everything, whether it was that he was overwhelmed with most heavy grief because of Tiberius (for it was evident to everyone that he grieved exceedingly as if for a near relation, both by his continued depression of spirits and his incessant weeping, pouring forth tears without end as if from an inexhaustible fountain), or whether it was because he was disaffected to his successor, because he preferred devoting himself to the party of the real rather than to that of the adopted children, or whether it was because he had been one of those who had joined in the conspiracy against the mother of Caius, having joined against her at the time when the accusations were brought against her, on account of which she was put to death, and having escaped through fear of the consequence of proceeding against him.</s></div>
<div id="Section10" n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section10Sent1" n="1">However, for a time he still paid some attention to the affairs of the state, not wholly abandoning the administration of his government; but when he heard that the grandson of Tiberius and his partner in the government had been put to death at the command of Caius, he was smitten with intolerable anguish, and threw himself on the ground, and lay there speechless, being utterly deprived of his senses, for indeed his mind had long since been enervated by grief.</s></div>
<div id="Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section11Sent1" n="1">For as long as that child lived he did not despair of some sparks still remaining of his own safety, but now that he was dead, he considered that all his own hopes had likewise died with him, even if a slight breeze of assistance might still be left, such as his friendship with Macro, who had unbounded</s><s id="Section11Sent2" n="2">influence with Caius in his authority; and who, as it is said, had very greatly contributed to his obtaining the supreme power, and in a still higher degree to his personal safety,</s></div>
<div id="Section12" n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section12Sent1" n="1">since Tiberius had frequently thought of putting Caius out of the way, as a wicked man and one who was in no respects calculated by nature for the exercise of authority, being influenced also partly by his apprehensions for his grandson; for he feared lest, when he himself was dead, his death too would be added to the funerals of his family.</s><s id="Section12Sent2" n="2">But Macro had constantly bade him discard these apprehensions from his mind, and had praised Caius, as a man of a simple, and honest, and sociable character; and as one who was very much attached to his cousin, so that he would willingly yield the supreme authority to him alone, and the first rank in everything.</s></div>
<div id="Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section13Sent1" n="1">And Tiberius, being deceived by all these representations, without being aware of what he was doing, left behind him a most irreconcileable enemy, to himself, and his grandson, and his whole family, and to Macro, who was his chief adviser and comforter, and to all mankind;</s></div>
<div id="Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section14Sent1" n="1">for when Macro saw that Caius was forsaking the way of virtue and yielding to his unbridled passions, following them wherever they led him and against whatever objects they led him, he admonished and reproved him, looking upon him as the same Caius who, while Tiberius was alive, was mild-tempered and docile; but to his misery he suffered most terrible punishment for his exceeding good-will, being put to death with his wife, and children, and all his family, as a grievous and troublesome object to his new sovereign.</s></div>
<div id="Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section15Sent1" n="1">For whenever he saw him at a distance coming towards him, he used to speak in this manner to those who were with him: "Let us not smile; let us look sad: here comes the censor and monitor; the all-wise man, he who is beginning now to be the schoolmaster of a full-grown man, and of an emperor, after time itself has separated him from and discarded the tutors of his earliest infancy."</s></div>
<div id="Section16" n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section16Sent1" n="1">When, therefore, Flaccus learnt that he too was put to death, he utterly abandoned all other hope for the future, and was no longer able to apply himself to public affairs as he had done before, being enervated and wholly broken down in spirit.</s></div>
<div id="Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section17Sent1" n="1">But when a magistrate begins to despair of his power of exerting authority, it follows inevitably, that his subjects</s><s id="Section17Sent2" n="2">must quickly become disobedient, especially those who are naturally, at every trivial or common occurrence, inclined to show insubordination, and, among people of such a disposition, the Egyptian nation is preeminent, being constantly in the habit of exciting great seditions from very small sparks.</s></div>
<div id="Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section18Sent1" n="1">And being placed in a situation of great and perplexing difficulty he began to rage, and simultaneously, with the change of his disposition for the worse, he also altered everything which had existed before, beginning with his nearest friends and his most habitual customs; for he began to suspect and to drive from him those who were well affected to him, and who were most sincerely his friends, and he reconciled himself to those who were originally his declared enemies, and he used them as advisers under all circumstances;</s></div>
<div id="Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section19Sent1" n="1">but they, for they persisted in their ill-will, being reconciled with him only in words and in appearance, but in their actions and in their hearts they bore him incurable enmity, and though only pretending a genuine friendship towards him, like actors in a theatre, they drew him over wholly to their side; and so the governor became a subject, and the subjects became the governor, advancing the most unprofitable opinions, and immediately confirming and insisting upon them;</s></div>
<div id="Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section20Sent1" n="1">for they became executors of all the plans which they had devised, treating him like a mute person on the stage, as one who was only, by way of making up the show, inscribed with the title of authority, being themselves a lot of Dionysiuses, demagogues, and of Lampos, a pack of cavillers and word-splitters; and of Isidoruses, sowers of sedition, busy-bodies, devisers of evil, troublers of the state; for this is the name which has, at last, been given to them.</s></div>
<div id="Section21" n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section21Sent1" n="1">All these men, having devised a most grievous design against the Jews, proceeded to put it in execution, and coming privately to Flaccus said to him,</s></div>
<div id="Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section22Sent1" n="1">"All your hope from the child of Tiberius Nero has now perished, and that which was your second best prospect, your companion Macro, is gone too, and you have no chance of favour with the emperor, therefore we must find another advocate, by whom Caius may be made propitious to us,</s></div>
<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">and that advocate is the city of Alexandria, which all the family of Augustus has honoured from the very beginning, and our present master above all the rest; and it will be a sufficient mediator in our behalf, if it can obtain one</s><s id="Section23Sent2" n="2">boon from you, and you cannot confer a greater benefit upon it than by abandoning and denouncing all the Jews."</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">Now though upon this he ought to have rejected and driven away the speakers as workers of revolution and common enemies, he agrees on the contrary to what they say, and at first he made his designs against the Jews less evident, only abstaining from listening to causes brought before his tribunal with impartiality and equity, and inclining more to one side than to the other, and not allowing to both sides an equal freedom of speech; but whenever any Jew came before him he showed his aversion to him, and departed from his habitual affability in their case; but afterwards he exhibited his hostility to them in a more conspicuous manner.</s></div>
<div id="Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section25Sent1" n="1">Moreover, some occurrences of the following description increased that folly and insolence of his which was derived from instruction rather than from nature.</s><s id="Section25Sent2" n="2">Caius Caesar gave Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the king, the third part of his paternal inheritance as a sovereignty, which Philip the tetrarch, who was his uncle on his father’s side, had previously enjoyed.</s></div>
<div id="Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section26Sent1" n="1">And when he was about to set out to take possession of his kingdom, Caius advised him to avoid the voyage from Brundusium to Syria, which was a long and troublesome one, and rather to take the shorter one by Alexandria, and to wait for the periodical winds; for he said that the merchant vessels which set forth from that harbour were fast sailers, and that the pilots were most experienced men, who guided their ships like skilful coachmen guide their horses, keeping them straight in the proper course.</s><s id="Section26Sent2" n="2">And he took his advice, looking upon him both as his master and also as a giver of good counsel.</s></div>
<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">Accordingly, going down to Dicaearchia, and seeing some Alexandrian vessels in the harbour, looking all ready and fit to put to sea, he embarked with his followers, and had a fair voyage, and so a few days afterwards he arrived at his journey’s end, unforeseen and unexpected, having commanded the captains of his vessels (for he came in sight of Pharos about twilight in the evening) to furl their sails, and to keep a short distance out of sight in the open sea, until it became late in the evening and dark, and then at night he entered the port, that when he disembarked he might find all the citizens buried in sleep, and so, without any one seeing him, he might arrive at the house of the man who was to be his entertainer.</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">With so much modesty then did this man arrive, wishing if it were possible to enter without being perceived by any one in the city.</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">For he had not come to see Alexandria, since he had sojourned in it before, when he was preparing to take his voyage to Rome to see Tiberius, but he desired at this time to take the quickest road, so as to arrive at his destination with the smallest possible delay.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">But the men of Alexandria being ready to burst with envy and ill-will (for the Egyptian disposition is by nature a most jealous and envious one and inclined to look on the good fortune of others as adversity to itself), and being at the same time filled with an ancient and what I may in a manner call an innate enmity towards the Jews, were indignant at any one’s becoming a king of the Jews, no less than if each individual among them had been deprived of an ancestral kingdom of his own inheritance.</s></div>
<div id="Section30" n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section30Sent1" n="1">And then again his friends and companions came and stirred up the miserable Flaccus, inviting, and exciting, and stimulating him to feel the same envy with themselves; saying, "The arrival of this man to take upon him his government is equivalent to a deposition of yourself.</s><s id="Section30Sent2" n="2">He is invested with a greater dignity of honour and glory than you.</s><s id="Section30Sent3" n="3">He attracts all eyes towards himself when they see the array of sentinels and body-guards around him adorned with silvered and gilded arms.</s></div>
<div id="Section31" n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section31Sent1" n="1">For ought he to have come into the presence of another governor, when it was in his power to have sailed over the sea, and so to have arrived in safety at his own government?</s><s id="Section31Sent2" n="2">For, indeed, if Caius did advise or rather command him to do so, he ought rather with earnest solicitations to have deprecated any visit to this country, in order that the real governor of it might not be brought into disrepute and appear to have his authority lessened by being apparently disregarded."</s></div>
<div id="Section32" n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section32Sent1" n="1">When he heard this he was more indignant than before, and in public indeed he pretended to be his companion and his friend, because of his fear of the man who directed his course, but secretly he bore him much ill-will, and told every one how he hated him, and abused him behind his back, and insulted him indirectly, since he did not dare to do so openly;</s></div>
<div id="Section33" n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section33Sent1" n="1">for he encouraged the idle and lazy mob of the city (and the mob of Alexandria is one accustomed to great license of speech, and</s><s id="Section33Sent2" n="2">one which delights above measure in calumny and evil-speaking), to abuse the king, either beginning to revile him in his own person, or else exhorting and exciting others to do so by the agency of persons who were accustomed to serve him in business of this kind.</s></div>
<div id="Section34" n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section34Sent1" n="1">And they, having had the cue given them, spent all their days reviling the king in the public schools, and stringing together all sorts of gibes to turn him into ridicule.</s><s id="Section34Sent2" n="2">And at times they employed poets who compose farces, and managers of puppet shows, displaying their natural aptitude for every kind of disgraceful employment, though they were very slow at learning anything that was creditable, but very acute, and quick, and ready at learning anything of an opposite nature.</s></div>
<div id="Section35" n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg030.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section35Sent1" n="1">For why did he not show his indignation, why did he not commit them to prison, why did he not chastise them for their insolent and disloyal evil speaking?</s><s id="Section35Sent2" n="2">And even if he had not been a king but only one of the household of Caesar, ought he not to have had some privileges and especial honours?</s><s id="Section35Sent3" n="3">The fact is that all these circumstances are an undeniable evidence that Flaccus was a participator in all this abuse; for he who might have punished it with the most extreme severity, and entirely checked it, and who yet took no steps to restrain it, was clearly convicted of having permitted and encouraged it; but whenever an ungoverned multitude begins a course of evil doing it never desists, but proceeds from one wickedness to another, continually doing some monstrous thing.</s></div>
