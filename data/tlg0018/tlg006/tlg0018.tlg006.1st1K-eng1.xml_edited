<div id="Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section19Sent1" n="1">You think, therefore, rightly that all the speediest things which are under heaven would appear to be standing still if compared with the rapidity of the sun, and moon, and other stars.</s><s id="Section19Sent2" n="2">And yet the whole heaven was made by God; and the maker always goes before that which is made.</s><s id="Section19Sent3" n="3">So that, of necessity, not only the other things which exist among us, but also that which has the most rapid motion of all, namely, the mind, may fall short of a proper comprehension of the great cause of all things by an undescribable distance.</s><s id="Section19Sent4" n="4">But the stars, as they are themselves in motion, pass by all things that move; but, though it seems incredible, God, while standing still, outstrips everything.</s></div>
<div id="Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section20Sent1" n="1">And it is said that he, at the same moment, is close to us and at a great distance, touching us with his creative or his punishing powers, which are close to each individual, and yet at the same time driving away the creature to an excessive distance from his nature as existing according to its essence, so that it cannot touch him without even the unalloyed and incorporeal efforts of the intellect.</s></div>
<div id="Section21" n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section21Sent1" n="1">Therefore we sympathise in joy with those who love God and</s><s id="Section21Sent2" n="2">seek to understand the nature of the living God, even if they fail to discover it; for the vague investigation of what is good is sufficient by itself to cheer the heart, even if it fail to attain the end that it desires.</s><s id="Section21Sent3" n="3">But we participate in indignation against that lover of himself, Cain; because he has left his soul without any conception whatever of the living God, having of deliberate purpose mutilated himself of that faculty by which alone he might have been able to see him.</s></div>
<div id="Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section22Sent1" n="1">It is worth while also to consider the wickedness into which a man who flies from the face of God is driven, since it is called a tempest.</s><s id="Section22Sent2" n="2">The law-giver showing, by this expression, that he who gives way to inconsiderate impulses without any stability or firmness exposes himself to surf and violent tossing, like those of the sea, when it is agitated in the winter season by contrary winds, and has never even a single glimpse of calm or tranquillity.</s><s id="Section22Sent3" n="3">But as when a ship having been tossed in the sea is agitated, it is then no longer fit to take a voyage or to anchor in harbour, but being tossed about hither and thither it leans first to one side and then to the other, and struggles in vain against the waves; so the wicked man, yielding to a perverse and insane disposition, and being unable to regulate his voyage through life without disaster, is constantly tossed about in perpetual expectation of an overturning of his life.</s></div>
<div id="Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section23Sent1" n="1">But the connection of the consequence affects me in no moderate degree; for it happens that that which comes near him who is standing still longs for tranquillity, as being something which resembles itself.</s><s id="Section23Sent2" n="2">Now that which stands still without any deviation is God, and that which is moved is the creature, so that he who comes near to God desires stability; but he who departs from him, as by so doing he is approaching a creature easily overturned, is borne towards that which resembles it.</s></div>
<div id="Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section24Sent1" n="1">On this account it is written in the curses contained in scripture, "Thou shalt never rest; nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot."</s><s id="Section24Sent2" n="2">And, a little afterwards, we read that, "Thy life shall hang in doubt before them."</s><s id="Section24Sent3" n="3">For it is the nature of the foolish man, who is always being tossed about in a manner contrary to right reason, to be hostile to tranquillity and rest, and not to stand firmly or with a sure</s><s id="Section24Sent4" n="4">foundation on any doctrine whatever.</s></div>
<div id="Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section25Sent1" n="1">Accordingly he is full of different opinions at different times, and sometimes, even in the same circumstances, without any new occurrence having arisen to affect them, he will be perfectly contrary to himself, —now great, now little, now hostile, now friendly; and, in short, he will, so to say, be everything that is most inconsistent in a moment of time.</s><s id="Section25Sent2" n="2">And, as the law-giver says, "All his life shall hang in doubt before him;" having no firm footing, but being constantly tossed about by opposing circumstances, which drag it different ways.</s></div>
<div id="Section26" n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section26Sent1" n="1">On which account Moses says, in another place, "Cursed of God is he that hangeth on a tree;"  because what he ought to hang upon is God.</s><s id="Section26Sent2" n="2">But such a man has, of his own accord, bound himself to the body, which is a wooden burden upon us, exchanging hope for desire and a perfect hope for the greatest of evils; for hope, being the expectation of good things, causes the mind to depend upon the bounteous God; but appetite, creating only unreasonable desires, depends on the body, which nature has made to be a sort of receptacle and abode for the soul.</s></div>
<div id="Section27" n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section27Sent1" n="1">Let these men, then, hang by their appetites as by a halter; but the wise Abraham, where he stands, comes near to God, who is also standing.</s><s id="Section27Sent2" n="2">For Moses says that "Abraham was standing near to God; and coming nigh unto him, he said,"  ...</s><s id="Section27Sent3" n="3">For in good truth the unalterable soul is the only thing that has access to the unalterable God; and being of such a disposition, it does really stand very near to the Divine power.</s></div>
<div id="Section28" n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section28Sent1" n="1">Therefore the oracle which was given to the all-wise Moses most manifestly shows the lasting good condition and stability of the virtuous man.</s><s id="Section28Sent2" n="2">Now, the oracle is as follows: "And do thou thyself stand with me."</s><s id="Section28Sent3" n="3">By which expression, two things are made clear.</s><s id="Section28Sent4" n="4">One, that it is the living God, who moves and turns about all other beings, being himself unchangeable and immoveable.</s><s id="Section28Sent5" n="5">The second is, that he makes the virtuous man a participator in his own tranquil nature.</s><s id="Section28Sent6" n="6">For, as I suppose, the crooked things are made straight by his straight rule; so, likewise, are the things that are in motion restrained and made stationary by the power of him who always stands still and firm.</s></div>
<div id="Section29" n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section29Sent1" n="1">In this passage, therefore, he commands another being to stand with him: but in another place he says, "I will go</s><s id="Section29Sent2" n="2">down with thee to Egypt, and I will conduct thee to the end."</s><s id="Section29Sent3" n="3">He does not say, Thou shalt go down with me.</s><s id="Section29Sent4" n="4">Why not?</s><s id="Section29Sent5" n="5">Because calmness and stability are the especial attributes of God; but a liability to change one’s place, and every kind of motion which has a tendency to change the place, is incident to a created being.</s><s id="Section29Sent6" n="6">When, therefore, he invites the man to his own peculiar good, he says, "Stand thou with me:" not "I will stand with thee."</s><s id="Section29Sent7" n="7">For "will stand," cannot be said of God, who always stands still.</s></div>
<div id="Section30" n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg006.1st1K-eng1"><s id="Section30Sent1" n="1">But when he comes to that which is the peculiar attribute of the creature, he says, with the most perfect correctness, "I will go down with you;" for change of place is adapted to you: so that no one shall go down with me, for in me there is no changing; but whatever is consistent with me, that is to say, with rest, shall stand.</s><s id="Section30Sent2" n="2">And with those who go down in such a manner as to change their place (for change of place is akin to and closely connected with them), I will go down also, not indeed changing my situation as to its actual place, inasmuch as I fill every place with myself.</s></div>
