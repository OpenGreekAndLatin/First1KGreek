<change when="2023-07-27" who="Lisa Cerrato">Further markup refinement: removed straight quote marks, used q/quote tags, fixed target ref, removed duplicate notes and changed attributed, refined milestones with books.</change>
<change when="2023-05-15" who="Gregory Crane">In 2023, GRC broke the translations up into works, cleaned up tagging of notes, and used digital files from CCEL.org to follow the sections as the appear in the David Scholer edition of the Yonge translation. He corrected 350+ errors but some surely remain.</change>

<div id="Book1Section3" n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section3Sent1" n="1">When, therefore, Moses says, God completed his works on the sixth day, we must understand that he is speaking not of a number of days, but that he takes six as a perfect number.</s><s id="Book1Section3Sent2" n="2">Since it is the first number which is equal in its parts, in the half, and the third and sixth parts, and since it is produced by the multiplication of two unequal factors, two and three.</s><s id="Book1Section3Sent3" n="3">And the numbers two and three exceed the incorporeality which exists in the unit; because the number two is an image of matter being divided into two parts and dissected like matter.</s><s id="Book1Section3Sent4" n="4">And the number three is an image of a solid body, because a solid can be divided according to a threefold division.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section4" n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section4Sent1" n="1">Not but what it is also akin to the motions of organic animals.</s><s id="Book1Section4Sent2" n="2">For an organic body is naturally capable of motion in six directions, forward, backwards, upwards, downwards, to the right, and to the left.</s><s id="Book1Section4Sent3" n="3">And at all events he desires to show that the races of mortal, and also of all the immortal beings, exist according to their appropriate numbers; measuring mortal beings, as I have said, by the number six, and the blessed and immortal beings by the number seven.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section5" n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section5Sent1" n="1">First, therefore, having desisted from the creation of mortal creatures on the seventh day, he began the formation of other and more divine beings.</s><s id="Book1Section5Sent2" n="2">For God never ceases from making something or other; but, as it is the property of fire to burn, and of snow to chill, so also it is the property of God to be creating.</s><s id="Book1Section5Sent3" n="3">And much more so, in proportion as he himself is to all other beings the author of their working.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section6" n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section6Sent1" n="1">Therefore the expression, he caused to rest, is very appropriately employed here, not he rested.</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent2" n="2">For he makes things to rest which appear to be producing others, but which in reality do not effect anything; but he himself never ceases from creating.</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent3" n="3">On which account Moses says, He caused to rest the things which he had begun.</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent4" n="4">For all the things that are made by our arts when completed stand still and remain; but all those which are accomplished by the knowledge of God are moved at subsequent times.</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent5" n="5">For their ends are the beginnings of other things; as, for instance, the end of day is the beginning of night.</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent6" n="6">And in the same</s><s id="Book1Section6Sent7" n="7">way we must look upon months and years when they come to an end as the beginning of those which are just about to follow them.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section7" n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section7Sent1" n="1">And so the generation of other things which are destroyed, and the destruction of others which are generated is completed, so that that is true which is said that—</s><s id="Book1Section7Sent2" n="2">And nought that is created wholly dies;</s><s id="Book1Section7Sent3" n="3">But one thing parted and combined with others Produces a fresh form.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section8" n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section8Sent1" n="1">But nature delights in the number seven.</s><s id="Book1Section8Sent2" n="2">For there are seven planets, going in continual opposition to the daily course of the heaven which always proceeds in the same direction.</s><s id="Book1Section8Sent3" n="3">And likewise the constellation of the Bear is made up of seven stars, which constellation is the cause of communication and unity among men, and not merely of traffic.</s><s id="Book1Section8Sent4" n="4">Again, the periodical changes of the moon, take place according to the number seven, that star having the greatest sympathy with the things on earth.</s><s id="Book1Section8Sent5" n="5">And the changes which the moon works in the air, it perfects chiefly in accordance with its own configurations on each seventh day.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section9" n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section9Sent1" n="1">At all events, all mortal things, as I have said before, drawing their more divine nature from the heaven, are moved in a manner which tends to their preservation in accordance with this number seven.</s><s id="Book1Section9Sent2" n="2">For who is there who does not know that those infants who are born at the end of the seventh month are likely to live, but those who have taken a longer time, so as to have abided eight months in the womb, are for the most part abortive births?</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section10" n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section10Sent1" n="1">And they say that man is a reasoning being in his first seven years, by which time he is a competent interpreter of ordinary nouns and verbs, making himself master of the faculty of speaking.</s><s id="Book1Section10Sent2" n="2">And in his second period of seven years, he arrives at the perfection of his nature; and this perfection is the power of generating a being like himself; for at about the age of fourteen we are able to beget a creature resembling ourselves.</s><s id="Book1Section10Sent3" n="3">Again, the third period of seven years is the termination of his growth; for up to the age of one and twenty years man keeps on increasing in size, and this time is called by many maturity.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section11" n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section11Sent1" n="1">Again, the irrational portion of the soul is divisible into seven portions; - the five senses, and the organ of speech, and the power of generation.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section12" n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section12Sent1" n="1">Again, the motions of the body are seven; the six organic motions, and the rotatory motion.</s><s id="Book1Section12Sent2" n="2">Also the entrails are seven—the stomach, the heart, the spleen, the liver, the lungs, and the two kidneys.</s><s id="Book1Section12Sent3" n="3">In like manner the limbs of the body amount to an equal number—the head, the neck, the chest, the two hands, the belly, the two feet.</s><s id="Book1Section12Sent4" n="4">Also the most important part of the animal, the face, is divisible according to a sevenfold division—the two eyes, and the two ears, and as many nostrils, and in the seventh place, the mouth.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section13" n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section13Sent1" n="1">Again, the secretions are seven—tears, mucus from the nose, saliva, the generative fluid, the two excremental discharges, and the sweat that proceeds from every part of the body.</s><s id="Book1Section13Sent2" n="2">Moreover, in diseases the seventh day is the most critical period—and in women the catamenial purifications extend to the seventh day.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section14" n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section14Sent1" n="1">And the power of this number has extended also to the most useful of the arts—namely, to grammar.</s><s id="Book1Section14Sent2" n="2">At all events, in grammar, the most excellent of the elements, and those which have the most powers, are the seven vowels.</s><s id="Book1Section14Sent3" n="3">And likewise in music, the lyre with seven strings is nearly the best of all instruments; because the euharmonic principle which is the most dignified of all the principles of melody, is especially perceived in connection with it.</s><s id="Book1Section14Sent4" n="4">Again, it happens that the tones of the voice are seven—the acute, the grave, the contracted, the aspirate, the lene, the long and the short sound.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section15" n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section15Sent1" n="1">The number seven is also the first number which is compounded of the perfect number, that is to say of six, and of the unit.</s><s id="Book1Section15Sent2" n="2">And in some sense the numbers which are below ten are either generated by, or do themselves generate those numbers which are below ten, and the number ten itself.</s><s id="Book1Section15Sent3" n="3">But the number seven neither generates any of the numbers below ten, nor is it generated by any of them.</s><s id="Book1Section15Sent4" n="4">On which account the Pythagoreans compare this number to the Goddess always a virgin who was born without a mother, because it was not generated by any other, and will not generate any other.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section16" n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section16Sent1" n="1">Accordingly, on the seventh day, God caused to rest from all his works which he had made.</s><s id="Book1Section16Sent2" n="2">Now, the meaning of this sentence is something of this kind.</s><s id="Book1Section16Sent3" n="3">God ceases from forming the races of mortal creatures when he begins to create  the divine races, which are akin to the nature of the number seven.</s><s id="Book1Section16Sent4" n="4">And the reference which is here contained to their moral character is of the following nature.</s><s id="Book1Section16Sent5" n="5">When that reason which is holy in accordance with the number seven has entered into the soul the number six is then arrested, and all the mortal things which this number appears to make.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section17" n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section17Sent1" n="1">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.</s><s id="Book1Section17Sent2" n="2">God blesses the manners which are formed in accordance with the seventh and divine light, as being truly light, and immediately declares them holy.</s><s id="Book1Section17Sent3" n="3">For that which is blessed, and that which is holy, are closely connected with one another.</s><s id="Book1Section17Sent4" n="4">On this account he says, concerning him who has vowed a great vow, that If a sudden change comes over him, and pollutes his mind, he shall no longer be holy.</s><s id="Book1Section17Sent5" n="5">But the previous days were not taken into the calculation, as was natural.</s><s id="Book1Section17Sent6" n="6">For those manners which are not holy are not counted, so that which is blessed is alone holy.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section18" n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section18Sent1" n="1">Correctly therefore, did Moses say that God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it he caused to rest from all his works which he had begun to make.</s><s id="Book1Section18Sent2" n="2">And this is the reason why he who lives and conducts himself in accordance with the seventh and perfect light is blessed and holy, since it is in accordance with his nature, that the creation of mortal beings was terminated.</s><s id="Book1Section18Sent3" n="3">For the case is thus: when the light of virtue, which is brilliant and really divine, rises up, then the generation of the contrary nature is checked.</s><s id="Book1Section18Sent4" n="4">And we have shown that God never desists from creating something, but that when he appears to do so he is only beginning the creation of something else; as being not only, the Creator, but also the Father of everything which exists.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section19" n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section19Sent1" n="1">This is the book of the generation of heaven and earth, when they were created.</s><s id="Book1Section19Sent2" n="2">This is perfect reason, which is put in motion in accordance with the number seven, being the beginning of the creation of that mind which was arranged according to the ideas, and also of the sensation arranged according to the ideas, and perceptible only by the intellect, if one can speak in such a manner.</s><s id="Book1Section19Sent3" n="3">And Moses calls the word of God a book, in which it is come to pass that the formations of other things are written down and engraved.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section20" n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section20Sent1" n="1">But, lest you should imagine that the Deity does anything  according to definite periods of time, while you should rather think that everything done by him is inscrutable in its nature, uncertain, unknown to, and incomprehensible by the race of mortal men.</s><s id="Book1Section20Sent2" n="2">Moses adds the words, when they were created, not defining the time when by any exact limitation, for what has been made by the Author of all things has no limitation.</s><s id="Book1Section20Sent3" n="3">And in this way the idea is excluded, that the universe was created in six days.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section21" n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section21Sent1" n="1">On which day God created the heaven and the earth, and every green herb of the field, before it appeared upon the earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up.</s><s id="Book1Section21Sent2" n="2">For God did not rain upon the earth, and man did not exist to cultivate the earth.</s><s id="Book1Section21Sent3" n="3">This day Moses has previously called a book, since at least he describes the generation of both heaven and earth in each place.</s><s id="Book1Section21Sent4" n="4">For by his most conspicuous and brilliant word, by one command, God makes both things: the idea of mind, which, speaking symbolically, he calls heaven, and the idea of sensation, which by a sign he named earth.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section22" n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section22Sent1" n="1">And he likens the idea of mind, and the idea of sensation to two fields; for the mind brings forth fruit, which consists in having intellectual perception; and sensation brings forth other fruits which consist in perceiving by the agency of the external senses.</s><s id="Book1Section22Sent2" n="2">And what he says has the following meaning; —as there was a previously existing idea of the particular mind, and also of the indivisible minds to serve as an archetype and model for either; and also a pre-existent idea of particular sensation, being, so to say, a sort of seal which gave impressions of forms, so before particular things perceptible only by the intellect had any existence, there was a pre-existent abstract idea of what was perceptible only by intellect, by participation in which the other things also received their names; and before particular objects perceptible by the external senses, existed, there was also a generic something perceptible by the external senses, in accordance with a participation in which, the other things perceptible by the external senses were created.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section23" n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section23Sent1" n="1">By the green herb of the field, Moses means that portion of the mind which is perceptible only by intellect.</s><s id="Book1Section23Sent2" n="2">For as in the field green things spring up and flourish, so also that which is perceptible only by the intellect is the fruit of the mind.</s><s id="Book1Section23Sent3" n="3">Therefore, before the particular something perceptible</s><s id="Book1Section23Sent4" n="4">only by intellect existed, God created the general something perceptible only by intellect, which also he correctly denominated the universe.</s><s id="Book1Section23Sent5" n="5">For since the particular something perceptible only by intellect is incomplete, that is not the universe; but that which is generic is the universe, as being complete.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section24" n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section24Sent1" n="1">And all the grass of the field, he proceeds, before it sprang up.</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent2" n="2">That is to say, before the particular things perceptible by the external senses sprang up, there existed the generic something perceptible by the external senses through the fore-knowledge of the Creator, which he again called the universe.</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent3" n="3">And very naturally he likened the things perceptible by the external senses to grass.</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent4" n="4">For as grass is the food of irrational animals, so also that which is perceptible by the external senses is assigned to the irrational portion of the soul.</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent5" n="5">For why, when he has previously mentioned the green herb of the field, does he add also and all the grass, as if grass were not green at all?</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent6" n="6">But the truth is, that by the green herb of the field, he means that which is perceptible by the intellect only, the budding forth of the mind.</s><s id="Book1Section24Sent7" n="7">But grass means that which is perceptible by the external senses, that being likewise the produce of the irrational part of the soul.</s></div>
<div id="Book1Section25" n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart" xml:base="urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0018.tlg002.1st1K-eng1:1"><s id="Book1Section25Sent1" n="1">For God did not rain upon the earth, and man did not exist to cultivate the earth, speaking in the strictest accordance with natural philosophy.</s><s id="Book1Section25Sent2" n="2">For if God did not shed the perceptions of things subject to them, like rain upon the senses, in that case the mind too would not labour nor employ itself about sensation.</s><s id="Book1Section25Sent3" n="3">For he himself would be unable to effect anything by himself, unless he were to pour forth, like rain or dew, colours upon the sight, and sounds upon the hearing, and flavour on the tastes, and on all the other senses, the things proper to produce the requisite effects.</s></div>
