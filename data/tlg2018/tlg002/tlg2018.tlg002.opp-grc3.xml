<head>PREFACE</head>
<p>THE text of the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius in
the following pages is that of E. Schwartz in volumes
i and ii. of Part II. of the edition of Eusebius in
Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der erstern
drei Gahrhunderte, published by the Berlin Academy.
Changes have only been introduced in a few very
small points, such as the accentuation of the proper
names in the genealogy of Christ.</p>
<p>I am most grateful to the Academy for its kindness
in allowing me the use of this magnificent
example of how a text ought to be edited.</p>
<p>In preparing the English I have in difficult passages
frequently consulted the translation of A.C.M‘Giffert
and have derived much benefit from his notes. I
am also greatly indebted to my friends Mrs.
Frederick Winslow, Professor Robert P. Blake, who
read proof-sheets and suggested many improvements,
and Miss Edith Coe, who helped at every stage,
and undertook the laborious work of verifying and
inserting the references which were taken from
Schwartz.</p>

<head>INTERODUCTION</head>
<p>I. The Life and Writings of Eusebius</p>
<p>No contemporary biography οf Εusebius is now
extant, for though one was published by Acacius, his
successor as bishop of Caesarea, it has been lost, and
we are dependent on a few vague statements in later
writers and on the eridence of his extant writings.</p>
<p>Ηe was probably born about the year 260. This
date is fixed by (1) the faet that he speaks of Dionysius
of Alexandria as having been alive in his time:
Dionysius was bishop of Αlexandria from about 247
to 265. (2) Ηe speaks of Ρaul οf samosata as a
contemporary: Ρaul was deposed in 270. (3) Ηe
speaks of Manes as belonging “ to yesterday and οur
times”: Manes lived during the episcopate of Felix
at Rome in 270—274. (4) After speaking of
of Alexandria, who became bishop in 247, and before
speaking of Dionysius of Rome (A.D. 259), he seems
draw a chronological line, stating that he now proposes
to relate the history of his οwn generation.1
Ηis parentage and the place of his birth are unknown.
It is true that Αrius in writing to Εusebius
of Νicomedia spoke οf him as the brother of the latter,
but it is probable that this meant no more than
“brother bishop.” Ηe was sometimes referred
<note type="footnote">1 H. E. iii. 28, v. 28, vii. 26, vii. 31; Theoph. iv. 30.
vol. 1</note>

<pb n="x"/>
as “ the Palestinian,” but this again was
merely to distinguish him from the other Εusebius,
and alluded to his Palestinian bishopric. His most
usual designation was “Εusebius οf Pamphilus.”
This doubtless means some elose relationship, and has
been interpreted as son, nephew, friend, οr slave of
Pamphilus. Αll these are possible, but none certain,
and in the absence of evidence a decision between
them connot be made.1 Pamphilus was a native of
Phoenicia who had studied in Alexandria and settled
in Caesarea. Ηe here collected a large library, including
some of the works of Origen and the original οf
the Hexapla.2 This library and the similar one made
by Bishop Alexander at Jerusalem were the main
sources from which Eusebius derived the material for
his books.</p>
<p>It is unknown at what time he was ordained deacon
or priest, and it has been doubted whethcr he was in
clerical orders at all until his election to the see οf
Caesarea. Ηe was imprisoned during the persecution
at Caesarea under the governor Firmilianus in
the year 309 but was neither tortured nor executed.
Many years afterwards, at the Council οf Tyre
(a. d. 835), he was accused by Potammon, the bishop
of Heraclea, of having betrayed the faith during
the persecution and having thus escaped. But no
evidence appears to have been produced that this was
so, and in the eontroversies of that ume neithcr side
was unduly reluctant to blacken the character of
their opponents; had there been any eridence it
would surely have been adduced.
Αfter the end οf the persecution in 313 Eusebius
<note type="footnote">1 Theodoret, H. E. i. 1; Nicephorus Callistus, H. E. vi. 37.
2 Eus. H. E. vi. 32.</note>

<pb n="xi"/>
was made bishop of caesarea, but the exact date is
doubtful; it must, however, have been before 315,
when as bishop οf Caesarea he attended the consecration
of the church in Tyre. In 325 he was present
at the Council of Nicaea, where he held a very
prominent place οn the right hand of the Εmperor
Constantine. It has sometimes been stated that he
was actually the president οf the Council, but this
cannot be proved and is even improbable. Both
before and after this time he appears to have been
the chief theological adviser of Constantine. His
general attitude during and after the Council was
that οf the moderate man. Ηe was not in agreement
with the party of Alexander,1 and appears to have
done his best to induce the Council to adopt a less
drastic creed. On the whole he probably was more
in agreement with Arius and with his namesake,
Εusebius of Kicomeffia, than with the opposite party,
but his policy and that of the Emperor was to seek a
formula of comprehension, while Alexander on the
οne hand and Αrius on the other desired formulae
which would exclude their opponents. In the end
he was obliged to rield to the preSsure of numbers
and appears to have voted with the majority in the
final decision; but he was never really convinced,
and for the rest of his life was an opponent οf the
Athanasian party, and a firm supporter of all attempts
to evict its leaders and to modify the ereed so as to
leave room for more difference of opinion οn metaphysical
questions.</p>
<p>Six years after the Council of Nicaea he was
present at the council of Antioch (a. d. 331), which
<note type="footnote">1 The Bishop of Alexandria, whose quarrel with Arius
was the immediate cause of the Arian controversy and οf
the Council οf Nicaea.</note>

<pb n="xii"/>
deposed Eustathius, one of the leaders of the anti-
Arian party. On this occasion he was offered the
bishopric of Antioch, but refused it, nominally at
least, because he was unwilling to transgress the
ecclesiastical rule that a bishop must not leave one
see for another. Three years later later (a. d. a
proposal was made to depose Αthanasius. Αn
attempt was apparently made to hold a eouncil for
this purpose at Caesarea, but it was unsuccessful, and
the synod was not actually held till a year later at
Tyre (a. d. 835). At this meeting, which Eusebius
attended, Athanasius was condemned on evidenee
which though apparently convincing was, to say
the least of it, mostly fraudulent. Athanasius was
accused of having cut off the hand of a certain bishop.
The hand was actually produeed as evidence, but not
the bishop, whom Athanasius afterwards discovered
and convicted οf possessing both hands.</p>
<p>In the same year Eusebius was the leading figure
at the synod of Jerusalem during which was held the
conseeration of the new church. This synod was
distinctly Arian in tendeney as indeed, were most of
the councils of the eastern clergy. Ιt was decided
to re-admit Arius, and action was begun against
Marcellus of Ancyra.1 In pursuance of this policy a
little later during the same year Εusebius attended
a Synod at Constantinople. Arius died on the eve
of his restoration, but Μarcellus was condemned, and
during the proceedings Eusebius was the chosen
<note type="footnote">1 Marcellus, bishop of Ancyra, was οne of the leaders
of the extieme anti-Arian party. Ηe was accused of
Sabellianism,—the heresy which regarded the Logos or Son
as merely a name for God when acting in a certain way, and
not as a separate “existence” or—to use the later word—
hypostasis. See especially Th. Zahn, Marcellus von Ancyra.</note>

<pb n="xiii"/>
orator at the famous “tricennalia,” the
the thirtieth year of Constantine's reign.</p>
<p>In 337 Constantine died and Εusebius did not long
survive him. The day of his death is known with
tolerable certainty, but not the year, for the Syriac
martyrology of the fourth century, which probably
represents the old calendar of Nicomedia, merely
says that Εusebius died on May the 30th. Since
Socrates, H. Ε. ii. 4, mentions his death in connexion
with events which took place in 389 and 340, and
since in 341, at the Synod of Antioch, Αcacius, the
successor of Εusebius, was present as bishop οf
Caesarea, the death of Eusebius must have taken
Ρlace on May the 30th in 339 or 340. Α definite
choice between these years is impossible, but, as
Lightfoot points out, the general impression made by
the statements in Socrates and Sozomen is that
death of Εusebius took place before that of the
younger Constantine and the second exile of Athansius.
These events were probably earlier in 340 than
May the 30th, so that probability slighty favours
339 rather than 340 as the year οf his death.1</p>
<p>Important though his ecclesiastical and political
career undoubtedly was, his literary achievements
are his chief claim to fame. Once more, there is
not extant any complete list of his writings. Jerome,
Nicephorus Callistus, and Ebed Jesu, the Syriac
writer, have given partial lists, and scattered though
the writings of Ρhotius are referenees to other works.
These are some help, but Εusebius himself is οur
chief source of information.</p>
<p>Ηe began to write in the last years οf the third
century or at the beginning οf the fourth. To the
<note type="footnote">1 Socrates, H. E. ii. 4 f. ; Sozomen, H. E. iii. 2.</note>

<pb n="xiv"/>
earliest period probably belong two books of controversy
with heathen writers. One, Adversus Hieroclem,
was an answer to the Philalethes of Hierocles,
who had compared Christ and Apollonius οf Tyana.
The work of Hierocles is unfortunately lost, but
Eusebius's book is extant. It is written in a style
rather markedly different from his later works, and
he never quotes it. There is, however, scarcely
sufficient reason for doubting its authenticity. It
was probably a work of his youth. The other book
of the same kind was an answer to Porphyry, a
heathen controversialist living in Caesarea, who had
attacked Origen and other Christians. The text of
this book is wholly lost, but a fragment which may
belong to it has been published by Ε. von der Goltz
in Texte und Untersuchungen, xvii. 4. pp. 41 ff. It is
also probable that to the same early period should be
ascribed a collection of the lives of the early martyrs.
This collection, which would be of inestimable value,
has unfortunately been lost, but it was used by the
old syriac martyrology and other traces of it have
been found in later collections οf the lives of saints.
finally, it is generally thought that a lost work οf his,
Περὶ τῆς τῶν παλαιῶν ἀνδρῶν πολυπαιδίας, quoted
by Basil the Great, De Spiritu Sancto, cap. 29, and
mentioned in Eusebius, Praeparatio, vii. 8. 29 and
Demonstratio, i. 9. 20, may belong to this period.</p>
<p>The next period of his life is the ten years of the
Diocletian persecution, 303—313. During this
and possibly even before it, Εusebius was busy with
a great project of connected works dealing with
the history and philosophy οf Christianity. Though
they have not all been preserved the greater part of
these books remain and are the most valuable extant

<pb n="xv"/>
monument of Christianity as it was immediately
before the Council of Nicaea. Ρart of his great
claim to distinction is that when writing philosophy
he never neglects history, οr philosophy when
writing history.</p>
<p>The position of Eusebius is that the Logos existed
from the beginning with God the Father. As might
be expected from one who wrote earher than the
Couneil of Nicaea and was afterwards suspected of a
tendency to Arianism, he expresses himself with
some ambiguity as to whether the Son, or Logos, was
created by the Father. The Father was the creator
of the universe and all creation within it the work of
the Logos. Μan, however, was made by the Father,
though the Logos shared in the plan of his creation.
Αfter the creation it was the Logos who appeared
to the righteous; and Εusebius thus explains the
visions of Abraham, Μoses, Jaeob, and Joshua, as
well as all referenees to Wisdom in the sapiential
bookS. Ηe explains that this doctrine of the Logos
would have been promulgated long ago, had not men
been too wicked to understand it, and that it was
actually, though obscurely, contained in the Οld
Testament, as is shown by passages in the Οld Testamenat
which should be regarded as foretelling even
the names of Jesus and of Christ. Jesus, according
to him, was the incarnate Logos, who came to
announee himself and to point out to men the duty
of reverencing and worshipping him. Finally, he
maintains that the teaching of Christianity was
neither new nor Strange. What was new was the
Church, the race of Christians. Their corporate
existence, their general piety, and their inerearing
influence were indeed new, but their teaching was

<pb n="xvi"/>
not. It had been followed centuries before them by
Abraham and Moses and the later prophets; and the
religion of the patriarchs was identical with that of
the Christians. All history was a contest between
God, acting through Patriarchs, Prophets, and the
Church, on the one hand, and the Devil, instigating
Jews, Persecutors, and Heretics, on the other. It is
a contest in which the Devil always gets the worst of
it in the long run, but the righteous suffer considerably
in the process; and part of the plan of Eusebius
is to reveal the machinations of the Evil One and his
followers, and to show the catastrophes which befell
Persecutors, Jews, and Heretics.</p>
<p>The student of church history will have little
difficulty in recognizing that this teaching is in the
direct line of Justin Martyr, Aristides, Clement of
Alexandria, and Origen. In some ways he was the
last and the greatest of the. Apologists, for after his
time, when the Church was accepted within the
Empire, there was no reason for anyone to write
quite the same argumentative justification of
Christian religion as was incumbent upon him. It
would be interesting if we could know how far his
works, incomparably more logical than those of his
predecessors, converted the educated classes in the
Empire. Origen, no doubt, and Clement of
Alexandria were his superiors as philosophers, but
neither of them had the same grasp of history and
of historical presentation.</p>
<p>To attempt to arrange in chronological order the
books which he wrote during this period is misleading.
He was doubtless constantly working on the material
used in them all, and although it is possible to make
a few statements about their relative chronology,

<pb n="xvii"/>
this applies only to the dates at which they were
begun οr at which they were finally put into
writing.</p>
<p>Αt the head οf the series must be placed the
Chronicon. Eusebius perceived that the foundation
of history is accurate chronology and for this purpose,
using no doubt as the basis of his work the earlier
efforts of Julius Africanus and others, and partly at
least controverting their position, he produced a
work which is now extant in the form οf elaborate
tables arranged in parallel columns illustrating the
whole history of the world year by year. These
form the Χρονικοὶ κανόνες, which have been preserved
in an Armenian translation and in the Latin version
of Jerome. Whether this was the original form of
Eusebius's οwn work is οpen to question. Ρossibly
it is a later, more precise but less trustworthy
recension.1 To these tables was prefixed a Χρονογραφία,
or explanation and introduction, which has
unfortunately been lost. From references in
Eclogae i. 1 and i. 8, it would appear that this
work was produced before 303, but according to
Jerome Εusebius afterwards re-edited it, carrying
it down to 325.</p>
<p>During the years οf persecution which followed he
began two great connected works entitled the
Praeparatio Euangelica and the Demonstratio Euangelica,
dedicated to Theodotus, bishop οf Laodieaea.
The beginning of these bookss can be dated as after
303 and before 313, for both Praeparatio, xii. 10. 7
and Demonstratio, iii. 5. 7 refer to the persecution as
<note type="footnote">1 see Schwartz's Ρrοlegοmena to the Hist Eccl. pp.
ccxv ff.</note>

<pb n="xviii"/>
still raging. Nevertheless, the Demonstration was not
finished until after the Ρeace, to which a reference is
made in Demonstratio, v. 3. 11.</p>
<p>The Praeparatio is fully extant, but or the Demonstratio,
which originally contalned twenty books, only
the first ten are preserved. Taken together they
constitute a statement of the positive and negative
cases for Christianity as Eusebius conceived them.
The Praeparatio is especially concerned with the treatment
of heathenism which it describes and refutes.
The Demonstratio shows how the prophets foretold
Christianity, and how the religion of the Chrirtians
was not new but was identieal With that Which had
been followed by the patriarchs and saints οf Old
Testament days even before the time of Moses. It
is thus ineidentally an</p>
<p>Closely connected with these two books is a third
called Ἡ καθόλου στοιχειώδης εἰσαγωγή, or General
Elementary Introduction, in ten books, of which four
are extant in the form of the Προφητικαὶ ἐκλογαί,
commonly quoted as the Eclogae, or Prophetic
Extracts. Ιt is not quite clear what was the relation
of this book to the Εἰσαγωγή, but apparently it was
an extract from the larger work. Ιt must have been
begun berore 313, as it contains a reference to the
persecution as still continuing (Ecl. i. 8). Ιt presents
another version of the same argument from prophecy
as is contained in the Demonstratio, and lists οf
passages are given from the Old Testament, which
are held to refer to the person and work of Christ.
The first book of the Eclogae is devoted to the historical
books of the Οld Testanlent, the seeond to the
Psalms, the third to the remaining poetical books

<pb n="xix"/>
and the other prophets, the fourth to Isaiah. The
other books of the Εἰσαγωγή are lost.</p>
<p>If Photius can be trusted, Eusebius also wrote,
possibly at this time, two other books of a similar
nature, the Praeparatio Ecclesiastica, and the Demonstratio
Ecclesiastica. Both of these have entirely
perished, but it is supposed that they dealt with the
church in the same way as the Praeparatio Evangelica
and Demonstratio Evangelica dealt with the coming
of Christ. Lightfoot thinks that there is an allusion
to the Demonstratio Ecclesiastica in the Praeparatio
Evangelica, i. 3. 11, where Eusebius says that he had
gathered together in a speeial work the sayings of
Christ relative to the foundation of his church and
had compared them with the events. Lightfoot
also thinks that it is possible that Book IV. of the
Theophania may have been adapted from the Demonstratio
Ecclessiastica, just as other parts οf the Theophania
(for instance Book V.) are adapted from the
Demonstratio Evangelica.</p>
<p>Before Eusebius had finished writing the Demonstratio
Evangelica the persecution was ended (or at
least seemed to be ended) by the Edict of Toleration
in 311, and Εusebius seems to have broken off from
his dogmatic writings to write a history of the church
on the basis of the facts which he had already
collected and in Ρart published in the Chronicon.</p>
<p>This Church History, tranriated in the present
volumes, passed during the life of Εusebius himself
through several Stages which may not unfairiy be
called editions.</p>
<p>1. The first edition consisted of Books I.-VIII. Ιt
was Ρlanned in 311, for in the preface to the first

<pb n="xx"/>
book Εusebius says that he will describe “the
martyrdoms of οur own time and the gracious and
favouring help of our Saviour in them all”
in Book viii. 16. 1 he says that the Edict of Tolerance
in 311 was “the gracious and favouring interposition
of God.” The similarity of phrase suggests that
same event—the Εdict of Toleranee—is intended in
both passages. This conclusion may be supported
by small difference of plan which show that the
minth book was not part of the original scheme,
and that the οriginal tert of the eighth book
has been somewhat modified in the later
editions, to which all the extant MSS. belong. The
details can best be found in Schwartz's introduction,
page Ivi.</p>
<p>2. The second effition added Book IX., which was
necessary because the persecution, which seemed to
have ceased in 311, was revived by Maximin, and the
defeat of Maximin by Licinius appeared the really
decisive moment. This second edition was probably
produced in 315</p>
<p>3. The third edition added the tenth book in order
to close the story with the dedication of the basilica
at Tyre. Εusebius says that he did this at the
request of Paulinus, bishop of Tyre, “ adding at this
time the tenth book to those that were already completed
of the Ecclesiastical History” (H. E. x. 1. 2).
Schwartz thinks that he also moved a collection of
documents from their original position in Book IX.
to the end of Book X., and added a paragraph to the
eighth book on the death of the four emperors.
This edition would belong to the year 317.</p>
<p>4. The fourth edition came after the fall of Licinius
in 323, and consisted in the main οf the removal of

<pb n="xxi"/>
passages inconsistent with the Damnatio Memoriae of
Licinius. The evidence for this last edition is in the
main textual. The group οf manuscripts ATER
contain a number of passages omitted in BDM, and a
large proportion οf them seem to be connected with
Licinius. It is thought that though all the existing
manuscripts represent the fourth edition, from which
these passages had been omitted in accordance with
the Mamnatio Memoriae οf Licinius, the group ΑTΕR
had been corrected from a copy of the third edition,
which, of course, contained these passages.</p>
<p>This theory of four editions οf the Ecclesiastical
History is taken from Ε. Schwartz's Prolegomena,
pp. xlvii ff. which should be carefully studied, as
they supersede all earlier investigations. It should
be noted that the evidence for the 3rd and 4th
editions is textual, for the 2nd and 3rd internal and
οgical.</p>
<p>Α rival theory has been propounded by Η. J.
Lawlor in his Eusebiana, pp. 243 ff. Ηe thinks that
Εusebius had begun to write his Church Ηistory
somewhat earlier than the date assigned by Schwartz,
and in this agrees with the view stated by Ηarnack
in his Chronologie, ii. pp. 111 ff. The theory has
the advantage that it gives Εusebius rather more
time for completing so large a book; and it neccessitates
the view, by no means improbable in itself,
that he wrote the Introduction in Book I. after he had
finished the narrative properly so called. Ηe had,
according to Lawlor, nearly completed the Seventh
Book οf the History, which brought the story down to
his own time, when suddenly the Edict of Toleration
was issued by Galerius and his colleagues. This
event, which appeared to have ushered in a period of

<pb n="xxii"/>
peace to the church after a most cruel persecution,
was seized upon by him as the natural end οf his
story. Ηe therefore wrote a sketch of the history of
the persecution as the eighth and hst book οf his
work, and published the whole. Α little later he
added an abridged from οf his Palestinian Martyrs,
which he had written in the interval as a supplement
to the eighth book, and this addition, according to
Lawlor, may be regarded as a second edition οf the
Church History. But the persecution was resumed,
and when the Εdict οf Milan οnce more re-established
toleratio, Εusebius produced a third edition of the
Historia Ecclesiastica, revising Book VIII., making
a few changes in Book VII. and in the Palestinian
Martyrs, and adding Book IX., thus bringing the
whole to an end with the text οf the letter of Licinius
dated June the 13th, 313. The date of this edition
would therefore be soon after the end οf 313. Α
fourth edition was produced eleven years later, adding
the tenth Book, and the whole work in its present
form was finished in 324 or a little later.</p>
<p>The weakest spot in this theory seems to be that it
attaches too little weight to the statement of Eusebius
that he added the tenth book in order to please
the bishop of Tyre, which certainly suggests an
earlier date than 323, inasmuch as the church at
Tyre was dedicated in 317. But Lawlor's suggestion
that there was never more than one edition of Book
X. is important for textual reasons. It would on the
whole tend to give greater value to the ΑTΕR group
and rather less to the BDM group, which Schwartz
on the whole prefers. The opinion οf the presen
editor inclines somewhat to Schwartz's interpretation
of the phenomena, but the suggestion that the first

<pb n="xxiii"/>
edition of the Historia Ecclesiastica was begun rather
earlier than Schwartz suggests has many advantages.</p>
<p>Ιt is probable that the Chronicon, the Historia
Ecclesiastica, the Praeparatio Evangelica, the Demonstratio
Evangelica, the Eclogae Propheticae, and
possibly the Demonstratio and Praeparatio Ecclesiastica,
comprise the whole οf the original plan of
Εusebius. But the exigencies of events which
forced him somewhat to change the plan of the
Historia Ecclesiastica also led to his writing some
subsidiary books during this period.</p>
<p>The most important of these is the Palestinian
Martyrs, which has, like the Historia Ecclesiastica, a
complicated textual history. Ιt is known in two
forms, the longer found only in Syriac, though
undoubtedly based On a lost Greek original, and the
shorter preserved in the group ATER of the manuscripts
of the Historia Ecclesiastica, and inserted
immediately after Book VIII. The relation of these
two forms to each other and to the Historia Ecclesiastica
affords a problem which will probably never
be solved. Lightfoot and Lawlor believe that the
longer form is the earlier; Schwartz thinks that the
shorter is Eusebius's original draft, but that he
lengthened it himself. All agree that it is extremely
probable that both forms are due to Eusebius himself.
The relation οf the shorter form to the Historia
Ecclesiastica depends somewhat on the view taken οf
the textual history of the Historia. On Schwartz's
view of the manuscript evidence it seems almost
certain that the Palestinian Martyrs was omitted from
the last edition of the Historia Ecclesiastica, but that
it probably belonged to the third which influenced
the group of manuscripts ATER. Υet it is scarcely

<pb n="xxiv"/>
probable that it was not inserted before the third
edition. Ιts position between the eighth and the
ninth books suggests that it was added by Εusebius to
the first edition which ended with Book VIII., and
this addition constituted lawlor's “second adition.’’
But there can be, from the nature of the case, no
certainty οn this point. Αll that is clear is that the
book has every claim of internal evidence to be
regarded as a true work of Eusebius, and that when
the recension ΑTΕR was made the scribe had access
to another manuscript, not that which he was actually
copying, which contained its text after the end of
Book VIII. What that manuscript was must remain
uncertain, as there is no evidence whatever on the
subject. Similarly, it is not likely that complete
certainty will ever be attained as to the relation
between the two forms of the text; the evidence
is too conflicting.</p>
<p>With regard to the whole complicated series οf
problems afforded by the composition and text οf
the Historia Ecclesiastica and the Palestinian Martyrs,
it may be said that the wisest method for a student
to pursue is to begin by reading the essay οf Lightfoot
in the Dictionary of Christian Biography, supplementing
it by Ηarnack’s treatment in his Altchristliche
Literatur and in his Chronologie, and then, and
not till then, to go οn to the more detailed, more
thorough, but far more difficult books of Schwartz and
Lawlor, both of which are quite indispensable to a
proper knowledge οf the subject.</p>
<p>During the last years of the persecution, Εusebius
collaborated with Ρamphilus in writing a Defence of
Origen. when Ρamphilus was martyred he finished

<pb n="xxv"/>
the work by himself, and also wrote the Life of
Pamphilus. Both books are unfortunately lost. Ηe
also wrote, in two volumes, a work called by Jerome
the De evangeliorum diaphonia, but in the Greek
entitled the Ζητήματα καὶ λύσεις εἰς τὴν γενεαλογίαν
τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν πρὸς Στέφανον and the Ζητήματα
καὶ λύσεις εἰς τὴν ἀνάστασιν τοῦ Σωτῆρος πρὸς Μαρῖνον.
These are οnly extant in the form of an epitome, but
large fragments of the original have been found.
It is possible, but quite uncertam; that there may
be some eonnexion between this book and the
system of “Canons’’ which Εusebius invented to
facilitate the comparative study of the Gospels.
These canons divide the paragraphs of the Gospels,
quoted by the numbers given by Ammonius,1 into ten
groups, according as the material in them is found in
all four Gospels, in only one, οr in any of the possible
combinations of two or three Gospels. Εusebius
published this apparatus with an explanation in a
“letter to Carpianus,” of whom nothing
The earliest manuscript of the New Testament
which contains this system is the Codex Sinaiticus
which may have been written in Caesarea during the
life οf Εusebius, but more probably is a little later
and came from Alexandria.</p>
<p>Αfter Νicaea Εusebius scarcely produced so
many books as he did in the time of the persecution
and the days immediately succeeding it. This, no
doubt, was due to his elevation to the bishoprie of
Caesarea. Ηe seems to have busied himself with
exegetical writing, and there are large fragments

chapters in οrder to facilitate their use. These chapters are
commonly found in Greek MSS. and are known as the

extant of a commentary on the Psalms, another
Luke, another οn Isaiah, and perhaps another
1 Corinthians, which probably belong to this peri
but none are fully extant and their further recov
depends in the main on the study οf catenae.1</p>
<p>Ηe also produced four connected works deali
with the geography of the Bible. These comprise
translation into Greek of foreign words found in th
Bible, a description οf ancient Judaea, a plan
Jerusalem and the temple, and a treatise οn
names of the places mentioned in the Bible.

<p>of doubtful authentieity, but sometimes ascribed
to Εusebius and to this period, is a little book on the
nomenclature οf the book of the Prophets containing
a short account of the several prophets and their
works.</p>
<p>In the last years of his life Eusebius was busy with
two main achievements. He regarded Marcellus of
Αncyra with somewhat the same feelings as Athanasius
regarded Arius, that is to say as the real leader
of the attempts to disturb the peace and unity οf the
church by essentially οne-sided and erroneous teaching.
Ηe therefore wrote two treauses againsty
Marcellus, one generally known as the Contra
Marcellum, the οther as the De ecclesiastica theo 1

interpreters linked together into a “Chain’’ οf comment.</note>

<pb n="xxvii"/>
logia. Both of these were published after 335. Ηe
also wrote and published a book on the life οf Constantine,
which was not so much a full biography as a
panegyric, important to us because it contains much
information about the Council οf Νicaea and the
further ecclesiastieal actirities of the Εmperor.
With this, or closely connected with it, came also the
publication of the speech known as the De laudibus
Constantini, which Eusebius delivered in honour οf
Constantine on his thirtieth anniversary, and an
edition of the speech which Constantine himself
made to the synod. Finally, it is probable that
during his last years he was engaged in writing the
volume known as the Theophania, which is in the
main a repetition of the same arguments as those
found in the Demonstratio, and in the opening
chapters of the Historia Ecclesiastica with regard to
the appearance of the Logos in the world. It was
probably his last work; it is extant only in syriae,
and apparently was never finished, but there is still
controversy among critics as to its date and relation
to the Demonstratio.</p>
<p>II. The Manuscripts of the Historia
Ecclesiastica</p>
<p>The primary MSS. of the Historia Ecclesiastica fall
into two main groups:</p>
<p>l. The group ΒDMΣL.</p>
<p>B, Codex Parisinus, 1431 (vellum, s. xi-xii),
formerly Colbert. 621 and Reg. 2280,
called Ε by Burton. In the Bibliothèque
Nationale.</p>

<pb n="xxviii"/>
<p>D, Codex Parisinus 1433 (vellum, s. xi-xii),
called F by Ηeikel. In the Bibliothèque
Νationale.</p>
<p>M, Codex Marcianus 838 (vellum, s. xii),
called Η by Burton. In St. Mark's
Library at Venice.</p>
<p>Σ, an ancient syriac version, probably made
early in the fifth century.</p>
<p>L, the translation of Rufinus made in 402.</p>
<p>In this group M most frequently differs from B and
D. Generally this seems due to error in M, but
sometimes BD have an error in common against M
owing to their having been influenced by a later
“learned’’ recension which did not effect M (see
p. xxix). The combination MD is usually inferior, so
that B is on the whole the best Ms. of the group.
The decision between B and M can often be made by
comparison with the second group of MSS. The Syriac
version is far better than Rufinus, who frequently
paraphrases and seems to have found Εusebius very
difficult to render literally, as, indeed, he is.</p>
<p>2. The group ΑTΕR:</p>
<p>Α, Codex Parisinus 1430 (vellum, s. xi),
formerly in the possession οf Cardinal
Mazarin. Called C by Burton. In the
Bibliothèque Nationale.</p>
<p>T, Codex Laurentianus 70,7 (vellum, s. x-xi),
called I by Burton. In the Laurentian
library in Florence.</p>
<p>Ε, Codex Laurentianus τὸ, 70, 20 (vellum, s. x),
called Κ by Burton. In the Laurentian
library in Florence.</p>
<p>R, Codex Mosquensis 50 (vellum, b. xii),
called J by Heikel. Ιn Moscow.</p>

<pb n="xxix"/>
<p>In this group Α is, generally speaking, the best,
though it has many individual errors. TER seem to
have a eommon clement, and probably represent a
later recension.</p>
<p>Schwartz thinks that BDMΣL represent the text
of the 4th edition of Eusebius, with mistakes but no
deliberate emendations. ΑTER represent the same
text οften corrected by a copy of the third edition.
It is, however, often free from the individual errors
of ΒDMΣL, which it serves to corect.</p>
<p>It can also be shown that there was a later
“learned” recension which has affected MSS. of
both groups, and is now found in ERBD and in some
corrections in T, quoted as Tc.</p>
<p>From these primary MSS. are derived the secondary
MSS. of the Historia Ecclesiastica. Schwartz has
investigated the text of all of them, and his results
can be shown most cleariy in the following scheme.</p>
<p>Α
Cod. Vatican. 399 (a)
Cod. Dresdpn. 85 Cod. Ottobon. 108 Cod. Laur. ]96
Cod. Marcianus 337
Cod. Parisinus Cod. Bodlelan.
1435 Misc. 2.3
(Burton's D, and(Burton's F, and
Valesius's Valesius's
Fuketianus) Savilianus)
T Ε B
Cod. Vatican. 150 cod. Sinait. 1183 Cod. Marcian. Cod. Paris
| | 339 (b) 1432 (β)
Cod. Vatican. 973 Cod. Paris. 1436 Cod. Vatican. 2205</p>

<pb n="xxx"/>
<p>Besides these codices which are unmixed descentants
of primary MSS. there are three others in which
the text of one of the primary MSS. has been “crossed’’
with readings found in the others. These are:</p>
<p>(1) Codex Parisinus, 1437 (paper, S. xiv), a descendant
Of B, crossed with some readings derived from the
A-family, probably from Cod. Dresden. 85 (or some
similar Ms.), rather than Α or a. Ιt was the basis of
the editio princeps of Stephanus (1544), and is quoted
by Valesius as Regius, by Burton as Α, and by
Schwegler as a and q. This double use by schwegler
is due to a curious accident: Burton (following
stroth and Heinichen) referred to this Ms. by error
as Ρaris. 1436, but he also possessed a collation of it
with the right number, and his posthumous editor,
not realizing that this collation referred to Burton's
Α, published it in an appendix. schwegler was
misled by this, and thus manufactured two MSS. out
of two collations of one MS.</p>
<p>(2) Codex Parisinus, 1434 (paper, S. xvi), a descendant
of Α crossed with B or a deseendant οf B. It
was occasionally used by Stephanus, and is quoted by
Valesius as Medicaeus, and by Burton as B.</p>
<p>(3) Codes Arundelianus, 539, in the British Museum
(paper, s. xv), a carelessly written descendant of Α
(not of a) crossed with the B group. Quoted by
Burton as G.</p>
<p>III. The Printed Text of the Historia
Ecclesiastica</p>
<p>The following independent editions of the Greek
text of the Historia Ecclesiastica have been published.</p>
<p>(1) Stephanus: Paris, 1544. Reprinted several

<pb n="xxxi"/>
times; the best of the later editions being at Geneva
in 1612 It was based on codd. Ρaris. 1437 and 1434.</p>
<p>(2) Valesius: Ρaris, 1659. This was based on four
MSS., the two used by Stephanus which Valesius
(Henri de Valois) called Regius (cod. Ρaris. 1437) and
Medicaeus (cod. Ρaris. 1434) and two others at Ρaris,
cod. Paris. 1430 (A), which was then in the possession
of Cardinal Mazarin, and cod. Paris. 1435, which he
called Fuketianus. To the text he added many
valuable notes which still are indispensable.</p>
<p>The edition of Valesius was reprinted at least three
times in the seventeenth century, at Mainz in 1672, at
Ρaris in 1677, and at Amsterdam in 1695. Αn excellent
reprint, containing some more note of Valesius
collected from scattered sources, was issued in 1720
by Reading in Cambridge; this was reprinted in
Turin in 1746, and in Migne's Patrologia Graeca in
Paris in 1857.</p>
<p>(3) Stroth: Halle, 1779. This edition was never
completed, nor has it now any valuc; but it deserves
to be mentioned if only for the pious memory or a
man whose aims and vision were greater than his
means. F. Α. Stroth collected much new information
as to MSS., but was unable to afford the expense
of obtaining collations, so that his real apparatus
remained that of Valesius.</p>
<p>(4) Zimmermann: Frankfort, 1822. E. Zimmerman's
edition was in the main little more than a
reprint of the text of Valesius and added nothing of
importance to the material for reconstructing text.</p>
<p>(5) Ηeiniehen, ed. 1: Leipzig, 1827. Heinichen's
edition of Eusebius is a good example of the waste of
labour incurred by those who edit texts on the basis
of inaccurate collations. His first edition was

<pb n="xxxii"/>
published in 1827. It did not go much beyond the
work of Zimmerman, or, in other words, of valesius.
In 1840 he published a Supplementa notarum ad
Eusebii Historiam Ecclesiasticum, which contained a
statement of the variants found in Burton and of
cod. Dresden. 185. Finally in 1868 he published a
second edition in which he collected all the information
which was to be found in prerious editions οf
Εusebius. some of the collations for this edition he
made himself, or had made for him, but they prove
to have been in almost every instance far from
satisfactory. Νοr did he seem to understand
pertectly the collations found in οther editions. The
result is that his book cannot be trusted and was
never likely to lead to true results.</p>
<p>(6) Burton: Oxford, 1838. This edition, by Edward
Burton, building οn and adding to the work of Stroth,
was unfortunately also based on imperfect collations.
But it contained for the first time the readings of
ΑTΕBM and of cod. Arundelianus. It was published,
after his death, at Oxford in 1838 and reissued in 1845
and again in 1856; it also served as the text of a
partial edition by W. Bright, issued in 1872 and 1881.</p>
<p>(7) Schwegler: Tübingen, 1852.
was in method a great improvement on its predecessors;
but its material was really that of Burton,
and schwegler's results are nullified by the inaccuracy
of the collations.</p>
<p>(8) Laemmer: Schaffhausen, 1859-62. This was a
thoroughly bad text, being in the main Schwegler's,
changed in many places to agree with cod. Mareianus
388 (M), which Laemmer thought was the best Ms.</p>
<p>(9) Dindoft: Leipzig, 1871. This is perhaps the
best known of all editions of Eusebius, as it was

<pb n="xxxiii"/>
issued in the convenient “Teubner texts,” but
is merely an inaceurate reprint of Schwegler.</p>
<p>(10) Schwartz: Leipzig, 1903. This edition has
rendered obsolete all except that of Valesius. It is
based on new and probably accurate collations of all the
known MSS. Its text is followed in thepresent volumes.
It is possible that some future editor may conceivably
reopen the question οf the merits οf the two groups of
primary MSS., but he will have to build on Schwartz's
work. It is not a commentary, but much of the
material on which a commentary could be based is
to be found in the references given in its apparatus.</p>
<p>The fullest statement of the printed effitions of
Eusebius and the manuscripts upon which they are
based is to be found in an article by Α. C. Headlam in
the Journal of Theological Studies for October 1902.
pp. 93 ff. It is stated at the beginning of this
article that it is a draft of prolegomena for a projected
edition, but nothing more has yet appeared of this
great undertaking.</p>
<p>one other book remains to be mentioned although
it is not an edition of the text. The translation
of the Historia Ecclesiastica by Α. C. M‘Giffert
the Νicene and Ροst-Νicene Fathers, second Series,
vol. i., 1904, is provided with historical notes which
furnish the only valuable continuous supplement to
valesius: no student οf Εusebius can afford to neglect
them.</p>
<p>IV. the plan of eusebius in the Historia
Ecclesiastica and the sources which he used</p>
<p>The general plan of the Historia Ecclesiastica is
clear and lucid. The chronology adopted is that of

<pb n="xxxiv"/>
the Roman Emperors, and the events are arranged
reign by reign. But there is little or no attempt to
give any closer dating than this and the relation
between events during the same reign is not indicated.
To this there is one exception. The bishops of
Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem are given,
and in the case of Rome and Alexandria the exact
dates are given. Where did Eusebius obtain this
information? The researches of Lipsius, Lightfoot,
and Harnack have shown that he used the chronological
material collected by Hippolytus and
Africanus, and Lightfoot thought that there was a
still earlier list compiled by Hegesippus, but to
discuss at due length the problems involved would
demand more space than is at present available ;
since Harnack's Chronologie the main contributions
have been in reviews and periodicals, the chief
English writers being Η. J. Lawlor, C. Η. Turner,
and J. K. Fotheringham.</p>
<p>One further observation is necessary. The object
of the whole book was to present the Christian
“Succession,” which did not merely mean, though it
certainly included, the apostolic succession of the
bishops of the four great “thrones,” but rather the
whole intellectual, spiritual, and institutional life of
the Church. It cannot be too strongly emphasised
that Eusebius, like all early church historians, can
be understood only if it be recognized that whereas
modern writers try trace the development, growth,
and change of doctrines and institutions, their predecessors
were trying to prove that nothing of
the kind ever happened. According to them the
Church had had one and only one teaching from the
beginning; it had been preserved by the “Succes-

<pb n="xxxv"/>
sion’’ and heresy was the attempt οf the Devil to
change it.</p>
<p>In tracing “the succession’’ Eusebius quotes and
refers to many writers. To give any complete
description of them would be to write a handbook
to early Christian literature; but it seems desirable
to give a short account οf the chief writings referred
to in the books translated in this volume, book by
book, and to indicate the points of interest and
difficulty which they present.</p>
<p>Boox I—The chief sourees drawn on by
apart from the Νew Testament, are Josephus,
Africanus, and the Archives of Edessa.</p>
<p>Josephus.—Josephus, the son of Marthias, who
took the name οf Flavius in honour οf the emperors
of the Flavian house, was born in A.D. 37 or 38. Ηe
belonged to the highest Jewish aristocracy, being
descended on his mother's side from Jonathan the
Maccabee. After studying all the seets of the Jews
he became a Pharisee. Ηe went to Rome when he
was twenty-six years οld on a political mission, and
hereafter he appears to have been quite sincere in
his desire, though somewhat shifty in his tactics, to
bring about better relations between the Jews and
the Romans. During the Jewish war which began
in 66 he belonged to the moderate party, and was
entrusted with the command of Galilee. Ηis eareer
here was much hindered by the opposition of John οf
Gischala. Ηe was besieged in Jotatata, and at last
was forced to surrender. As he had preferred
surrender to death the Jews regarded him as a
renegade, and attributed the worst motives to his
persistent efforts to secure peace before the inevitable
catastrophe which he foresaw. Ηe became friendly

<pb n="xxxvi"/>
with Vespasian and Titus, and when the war ended
obtained a grant of lands in Palestine, the privilege
of Roman citizenship, and οther distinctions. Ηe
appears to have lived until after the year 100, as
his autobiography was written after the death οf
Agrippa II., who died in that year.</p>
<p>Αfter the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 he wrote the
history of the Jewish war (Bellum Iudaicum) in seven
books. Ιn this the first two books give an introductory
history from the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes
to the beginning οf the war; Books III.-VI.
describe the war down to the capture of Jemsalem;
and Book VII. describes the last scenes. This work
is said to have been accepted and even revised by
Vespasian and Titus. Its main object no doubt was
to make the Jews and the Romans understand each
other better, but a desire that they should appreciate
Josephus's own service to both sides can be clearly
seen.</p>
<p>Some years later Josephus supplemented this
work by a larger one giving the history of the Jewish
people up to the beginning of the war. This was
arranged in twenty books and was called the Ἀρχαιολογία
Ἰουδαική. This was translated into Latin as
the Antiquitates Iudaeorum, and it is therefore usuauy
quoted in English as the Antiquities. It was probably
completed about Α. D. 93.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after this Josephus also wrote
a work in two books in answer to Apion. This Apion
was a famous controversialist who lived in the middle
of the first century and wrote a history οf Egypt and
a book against the Jews. Ηe figures largely in the
Clementine homilies. Νone of his works are extant,
but the fragments which remain are collected in

<pb n="xxxvii"/>
Müller, Fragmenta Ἠῶ. Graec. (see also the
by Lightfoot in the Dictionary of Christian Biography.)</p>
<p>Finally in old age he wrote his autobiography,
usually quoted as the Vita.</p>
<p>Eusebius makes many quotations from Josephus,
whieh are usually accurate. Only in the account of the
death of Agrippa the First is there any serious divergence,
and this is probably accidental (see pp. 130 f.).</p>
<p>The best text of Josephus is that of Niese, Berlin,
1887. Niese also published in 1888 a smaller edition
omitung the apparatus criticus.</p>
<p>The first translation 1 in English that of Whiston,
which has been often reprinted, and was superficially
revised by shilleto in 1889—90. It is not free
inaccuracies, but Josephus is very difficult to render,
as his Greek is bad and his style obscure. Explanation
as well as a new translation is desirable, and
there are few books more needed by Scholars at the
present time than an historical commentary on the
second half of the Antiquities and on the Jervish War.
Αt present there is on neither any commentary.</p>
<p>Julius Africanus.—Julius Africanus, sometimes,
but probably wrongly, called Sextus or Sextus
Julius, is stated by suidas to have been a Libyan who
served in the army of Severus in 195, and afterwards
settled in Emmau (Nicopolis) though he probably
also spent some time in Alexandria. When his
home was ruined he went, in 221 or a little later, on
an embassy to the Emperor, either Elagabalus or
Alexander Severus, and was made the head of a
reparation commission Whieh rebuilt the city under
the name of Nicopolis. The exact time of his death
<note type="footnote">1 Vol. 1. οf a new translation by Η. st. J. Thackeray has
appeared in the Loeb Classical Library, and Vol. II. is in
the Ρress.</note>

<pb n="xxxviii"/>
is unknown, but he was still alive in 240 when he
corresponded with origen. Besides the information
given in the Historia Ecclesiastica of Εusebius and in
Eusebius Chron. ann. 221, some details are found in
Sozomen, Hist. Eccl. v. 1; in Jerome, De viris
illustribus, 63; in George syncellus, who may have
used the lost introduction to the Chronicon of Eusebius;
in Cedrenus, Hist. Comp. 207, and in Moses of
Chorene, ii. 27.</p>
<p>Ηe was οne of the most learned of the writers in
the third century. Ηis chief work was a treatise on
chronology in five books on which the Chronicon οf
Εusebius was largely based. This began with the
creation and went down at least to the year 221. It
appears to have consisted, like most chronological
books of the period, of two parts, a “Chronology’’
and a “Canon.” The “Chronology’’ was an
or a series of essays, on critical question; the
“Canon’’1 was a series of tables in which a summary
of events was arranged in parallel columns showing
how the numbers of years in one system, such as the
Greek olympiads, corresponded to another, such as
the years after Christ. Ηe appears to have written
in order to prove the “chiliastic’’ view οf history
rather than in the interests of pure chronology,
and οn this point Εusebius was controverting rather
than copying him. Apart from this, however, his
work was doubtless the source of much οf the framework
οf the Historia Ecclesiastica (see especially
Schwartz, Prolegomena, pp. ccxv ff.).</p>
<p>Besides this great book Africanus wrote a letter to
Aristides, whose identity is unknown, on thc dis-
<note type="footnote">1 Ιt should be noted that the word “Chronicon’’ is
properly used οf the canon, not οf the chronology.</note>

<pb n="xxxix"/>
crepancies between the genealogies in Matthew and
Luke. This is quoted in part by Eusebius, H. Ε. i. 7.
Αnd he also wrote a letter to Οrigen on the authenticity
οf the book of Susanna. This is referred to by
Εusebius, Η. Ε. vi. 31, and is preserved in several
manuscripts οf Οrigen.</p>
<p>The authentieity of these writings is undoubted.
There is also aseribed to him a work ealled κεστοί,
which means Girdles. It apparently consisted of a
collection of essays varying in character from Agriculture
to the Αrt of War. Α few extracts from this
book remain, but not Sufficient to prove or disprove
its ascription to Africanus.</p>
<p>The most convenient collection of the fragments of
Africanus is still that of Routh, Rel. Sacr. vol. ii. The
most important work on his writing has been done by
Η. Gelzer, Sextus Julius Africanus, 1880 and 1885, but
except for detailed study of the points raised by
Gelzer, a suffieient account is provided by the article
οn Africanus in the Dictionary of Christian Biography,
and by Harnack, Chronologie, ii. pp. 89 ff.</p>
<p>The Archives of Edessa.—According to Η.Ε. i. 12.
3 ff. Εusebius made uSe of material in the Archives
of Εdessa. These appear to have consisted of two
divisions. There was an ancient royal archive
at Εdessa and a later ecclesiastical one which was
probably not instituted until the beginning of the
fourth century. According to Moses of Chorene
Julius Αfricanus made use of all this material, which
was also known to the editor of the Chronicon Edessenum.
Ιt is not certain whether Εusebius had himself
seen this archive or made use of it only at secondhand
through the writings of Julius Αfricanus, but
in any case there is no reason to doubt the statement

<pb n="xl"/>
that the apocryphal story of Abgar Uchama was
found in the archives at Edessa. which is also the
probable source—direct οr indirect—for most οf the
information contained in Eusebius as to the history
of Christianity outside the Roman Empire in the
region of Mesopotamia and such details as the story
of Mani. The rather complicated questions concerning
the story of this archive can be studied best in
Hallier, Untersuchungen über die edess. Chronik
u. Unters. ix. 1, 1892).</p>
<p>Book ΙΙ.—In the second book Josephus is again
used, and extracts are made from Philo, Clement
Alexandria and Hegesippus.</p>
<p>Philo.—Philo was probably born about the year
30 B.C., and lived on until the beginning of the second
half of the first century Α.D. He belonged to a
wealthy and distinguished family in Alexandria.
Ηis brother, Alexander, was the Alabarch 1 of the city
and had close relations with the imperial family in
Rome. Philo was essentially a philosopher, and
spent his life endeavouring to reconcile the jewish
Law with the Platonic Faith. He was also a voluminous
writer and his books were treasured by Origen,
and so passed into the library at Caesarea and thence
into the general tradition of Christian writings.</p>
<p>The statements about Philo's writings in Book II.
οf the Historia Ecclesiastica are so confused that it
is desirable to give the facts about them in somewhat
clearer form.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 The name of a high local official in Alexandria. From
josephus, Antiq. xviii. 8. 1 it appears to be the name of the
head of the Jewish colony in Alexandria, but Cicero, Att.
ii. 17 applies the word to Pompey, apparently with the
meaning “tax-collector.”</note>

<pb n="xli"/>
<p>Ρhilo wrote three great books οn the Pentateuch:</p>
<p>(1) The Quaestiones et solutiones Ζητήματα καὶ λúτεις).
Ηοw far Ρhilo carried this book, which dealt with the
problems of the Pentateuch, is not known, but
Eusebius like ourselves, was unacquainted with any
work going beyond Exodus.</p>
<p>(2) The Legum allegoriae. This was divided into
a number of books of which three are known as
Legum allegoriarum libri i., ii., and iii., but the οthers
which follow, each with separate titles, were apparently
without numbers. The list of these books
is De cherubim et flammeo gladio (Gen. iii. 24), De
sacrificiis Abelis et Caini (Gen. iv. 2-4), Quod deterius
potiori insidiari soleat (Gen. iv. 8-15), De posteritate
Caini sibi visi sapientis et quo pacto sedem mutat (Gen.
iv. 16-25), De gigantibus (Gen. vi. 1-4), De agricultura
(Gen. ix. 20), De ebrietate (Gen. ix. 21), De sobrietate
(Gen. ix. 24-27), De confusione linguarum (Gen. xi. 1-9),
De migratione Abrhami (Gen. xii. 1-6), Quis rerum
divinarum haeres sit (Gen. xv. 2-8), De congressu
quaerendae eruditionis causa (Gen. xvi. 1-6), De profugis
(Gen. xvi. 6-14), De mutatione nominum (Gen. xvii.
1-22), De somniis liber i. (Gen. xxviii. 12 ff.).</p>
<p>(3) A Systematic Description of the Mosaic Legislation.
It is divided into three parts: The first deals with the
ereation of the world; this is known as the De mundi
opificio. Ιn the manuscripts and editions οf Ρhilo
this work has been placed at the beginning of Ρhilo’s
works, before the first book of the Legum allegoriae,
but it probably ought to be put back into the
position here claimed for it. The second part deals
with the biographies of the virtuous men of the Old
Testament, and is known as the Νόμοι ἄγραφοι. of
it are extant the De Abrahamo, and the De Iosepho,

<pb n="xlii"/>
also known as Τhe Statesman ὁ Πολιτικός), because
Joseph was treated by Philo as illustrating th
virtues of vivic life. The third part of the Systematic
Desciption went οn to deal with the consideration
the Mosaic legislation properly so-called, and w
divided into two subdivisions, (a) the De Decalogo
(b) the De specialibus legibus οr the “consideratio
οf the special laws which follow the Ten Comman
ments and are connected with them.” This
contained in four books. To these were added two
appendices, οne οn three virtues, De fortitudine, De
caritate, De poenitentia, with the possible addition οf a
fourth, De nobilitate, and one on the treatment of the
good and evil under the title of De praemiis et poenis
and De execrationibus.</p>
<p>Besides these three great books οn the Pentateuch
Philo also wrote various single works: (1) the Vita
Mosis. (2) Quod omnis probus liber, with which went
another book now lost, Quod omnis improbus servus.
(3) Α great work which was apparently intended to
do something similar to that which Lactantius did
afterwards for the Christians in his book De morti
persecutorum, and to show that no one persecutcd the
Jews without suffering from the punishment οf God
at the end of his while while the Jews received the
rewards of their virtues. Probably he dealt in this
way with the careers οf Sejanus, Flaccus, Caligula,
and Pilate, but it is οnly the story οf Flaccus which is
at all fully preserved in the Adversus Flaccum and the
Legatio and Caium. It would appear that there were
originally five books in this work of which only the
two mentioned have been preserved.</p>
<p>Αnοther work published separately is the De
providentia, οnly found now om Armenian, which is

<pb n="xliii"/>
also the case with the De Alexandro et quod propriam
rationem muta animalia habeant.</p>
<p>Finally two books, now only partially preserved,
appear. to have been entitled the Ὑποθετικά and the
Defence of the jervs. Whether these were two οr one
seems doubtful. To these most critics add a long
book, still extant, De vita contemplativa, giring an
account of the Therapeutae in Εgypt, but there are
still a few who think that this is not a genuine work
οf Philo.</p>
<p>Ιt will be seen by comparing this list of the writings
of Ρhilο with the references made in Eusebius ii. <lb n="18"/>
that Εusebius has refeued to the greater number οf
writings of Ρhilο which are still extant, but he has
confused the order of the books so that if we did not
possess οther information it would be quite impossible
for us to reconstmct the relation of the sub-titles
which Εusebius quotes to the great divisions into
which Ρhilo’s works really fall. The most probable
suggestion is that of Dr. Lawlor, who thinks that
Εusebius knew Philo only through volumes οf tracts
which were preserved in the library at Caesarea, and
that he copied out the titles without always recognizing
the relation οf one tract to another, being
isled by the accidents οf binding (see Lawlor,
Eusebiana, pp. 138—145).</p>
<p>The fullest and best sources of information on
Ρhilo’s writings are Ε. Schürer, Geschichte des
Volkes, ed. 4, vol. iii. pp. 633—716; the prolegomena
Cohn and Wendland's edition, and the article in
the Dictionary of Christian Biography. The two
fullest editions are Mangey, London, 1742, and Cohn
and Wendland, Berlin, 1896—1915, which
everything except the fragments, for which Mangey

<pb n="xliv"/>
must still be consulted, and the Armenian
published by Aucher, Paralipomena Armena, 1826.
There is also a valuable edition οf the De vita contemplativa
by F. C. Conybeare.</p>
<p>Clement of Alexandria.—Clement of Αlexan
was probably born in the middle οf the secocentury.
According to Julius Africanus, quoted
Cedrenus, he came into fame in the reign οf Co
modus (A.D. 180—193) and the Chronicon οf
apparently assigns the date 193 to his ordination as
presbyter. According to Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica,
ii. 2. 64, he was converted to Christianity from
heathenism and was not born in the church, and
according to Epiphanius his birthplace was claimed
by Αthens as well as by Alexandria. Ηe travelled
much in the east, and towards the end of the second
century became head of the catechetical school
Alecandria. Ηe appears to have retired from public
life in Alexandria during the persecution under
Severus, A.D. 202 ff. According to the lerter d
Alexander, 1 who was bishop of Jerusalem in 212, and,
wrote about 211 from prison to the church at Antioch,
Clement had been living in the Cappadocian Cesarea
and must have been still alive when he wrote, as he
was going to carry Alexander's letter. According
to a later letter of the same Αlexander to Origen
Clement died soon after this, for this second letter,
which can hardly be later than 217 and may have
been earlier, implies that he was dead.</p>
<p>The list of Clement's writings is given by Eusebius,
Η.Ε. vi. 13. Of those to which he refers the προτρεπτικός
or Exhortation to the Greeks, 2 is completely
<note type="footnote">1 Quoted in Eusebius vi. 2. 6.
·2 This and the Quis dives salvetur are translated by
ὁ. W. Butterworth in the Loeb Classical Library.</note>

<pb n="xlv"/>
preserved as is also the Παιδαγωγός, or Instructor,
which is in three books. These two works seek to
have been intended as the first two parts of a
connected series. The first, the Προτρεπτικός, deals
with the Logos in relation to the conversion of the
heathen; ; the Παιδαγωγός also deals with the Logos
but in relation to morality ; and the third book was
intended to deal with the Logos as the teacher who
initiated man into true knowledge. Ιt is possible,
but far from certain, that the Στρωματεῖς 1 mentioned
by Εusebius and still partially preserved represent
this third volume.</p>
<p>Of the οther works mentioned by Εusebius only
fragments are found except the small treatise known
as Quis dives salvetur. The loss of the Hypotyposes <lb n="2"/>
is greatly to be regretted, but in addition to the
quotations preserved in Εusebius three οther fragements
have been thought to have originally belonged
to them. These are the Excerpta Theodoti,3 the
Eclogae propheticae, and the Adumbrationes in epistolas
canonicas. It has, however, been suggested that the
Excerpta Theodoit really belong to the eighth book
of the Στρωματεῖς. In any ease they are very valuable
information as to the teaching of Theodotus, for
they seem to represent the notes which Clement had
made rather than a finished literary production.</p>
<p>The best edition of Clement is that of Stählin,
Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei
<note type="footnote">1 Sometimes called Stromata ; the word means literally
“ patchwork ” and hence “ miscellanies.”</note>
<note type="footnote">2This appears to have been a commentary οn selected

Jahrhunderte, issued by the Berlin Acadeny. The
three volumes containing the text and introduction
of this edition are published ; the fourth volume,
which has not yet appeared, will contain the index
and some additional dissertations, but even as it
stands Stählin's edition takes the place of all
For the study of Clement special referenee should be
made to the writings of de Faye, especially his
Clément d' Alexandrie, 1898 (see also the
Clement of Αlexandria in Ηarnack’s Chronologie
vol. ii. pp. 1 ff.).</p>
<p>Hegesippus. — Ηegesippus appears to have been
of Ηebrew birth (Eusebius, Η. Ε. iv. 22), but there
is no evidence whether he was born a Christian or
converted from Judaism. Ηe certainly visited, and
perhaps lived in Rome. If Εusebius means in the
passage referred to that he lived until the time of
Eleutherus his death must have been between 175
and 189. The book from which Eusebius derived
much of his information as to the early church was
entitled Πέντε ὑπομνήματα ἐκκλησιαστικῶν πραξέων,
Five Treatises on the Acts of the Church. Whether
this was an ordered history or a collection of miscellaneous
οbservations cannot be proved, but the latter
view is more usually held, and the most probable
theory is that of Lawlor, who thinks that the ὑπομνήματα
were an aplogetic work which only contained a
few scattered references to history. Some confusion
periodically arises from the fact that in a recension
of Josephus, of which a Latin version appeared in
the fifth century, the name “ Josephus ” was spelt
“ Hegesippus.”</p>
<p>The extant fragments οf the genuine Ηegesippus
can be found in Routh, Rel. Sacr. vol. i. pp. 207-219,

<pb n="xlvii"/>
but more fully and with more complete reference to
the authorities in Lawlor's Eusebiana, pp. 98-107,
and the problem connected with him may be studied
best in that work and in the articles in Smith's
Dictionary of Christian Biography and in Herzog's
Real-Encyklopädie.</p>
<p>Book III. — In this book Josephus remains the
chief source of information about the Jews, while
Ηegesippus and Clement are drawn on for the history
of the Church ; but beside them Papias, Caius, Clement
of Rome, and Ignatius are quoted or referred to.</p>
<p>Papias. — Ρapias according to Eusebius (iii. 36)
was bishop οf Hierapolis, but we do not know the
exact chronology of his life. Irenaeus (Adv. haer.
v. 33. 4) says that he was a companion of Ρolycarp,
and he is quoted by Εusebius (iii. 39. 9) as claiming
to have seen the daughters of Philip the Evangelist,
so that he can scarcely have been born later than the
end of the first century. Ιn οne of the fragments
of his work preserved by Philip Sidetes (edited by
De Boor in Texte und Unter suchungen, v. 2) he refers
to the belief that those whom Christ raised from the
dead lived “ until the time οf Hadrian, ” so that he
can hardly have written earlier than 140.1 On the
other hand, as Irenaeus regarded him as belonging
to a past generation, he can scarcely have written
later than 160. Thus the middle of the second
century is probably the period at which he wrote.
Ηis work, from which Eusebius quotes, was entitled
Λογίων κυριακῶν ἐξήγησις. Unfortunately the book
is lost, and no one knows what the title means.
Λόγια generally means “ oracles, ” and is frequently
used οf the Old Testament, but it might be used of
<note type="footnote">1 Hadrian reigned from 117 to 137.</note>

<pb n="xlviii"/>
the teaching οf Jesus. The quotation given by
Εusebius iii. 39, which may come from the preface of
Ρapias, suggests, but does not prove, that the title
should be translated Oracles of the Lord rather than
Oracles about the Lord Thus it is uncertain whether
it was a work οn the interpretation of the Old Testament
or on the Gospels or on traditions behind the
Gospels. There is an enormous literature on the
subject, but most οf it is in the interests of some
theory οf the origin of the Synoptic Gospels and is
almost worthless. The clearest and best statement
of the facts is in Ηarnack’s Chronologie, i. pp. 356 ff.,
and on the interpretation οf the quotation in Εusebius,
Η.Ε. iii. 39, Dom Chapman's John the Presbyter
(Oxford, 1910), is peculiarly lucid and thorough.</p>
<p>Clement of Rome and Ignatius. — Both these writers
have left extant works which are published in the
Loeb Classical Library, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. i.</p>
<p>Caius. — Nothing is known of him except what
Eusebius tells us, but his writings and his relation
to the Alogi, who rejected the Gospel of John, have
been the subject οf an extensive literature, to which
the latest and most thorough contribution is made
by C. Schmidt in an elaborate appendix to his
edition of the “ Εpistοla Αpostolorum ” published in
1919 as Gespräche Jesu in Texte und Unter suchungen xliii.</p>
<p>Book IV. — In the fourth book Εusebius deals with
the last rebellion of the Jews, referring to Aristo of
Ρella, with the Αpologists of the time of Hadrian,
with the Gnostics οf the second century, with Justin
Martyr, with Polycarp and other martyrs, and with
Tatian. In the 21 st chapter he gives a list of the
chief Christian writers of the the time οf Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p>Aristo of Pella. — In Hist. Eccl. iv 6 Εusehius

<pb n="xlix"/>
describes the last war of the Jews against the Romans
in A.D. 132. Ηe refers to the account given by Aristo
of Ρella. The natural interpretation is that Aristo
had written a history of this time. But nothing is
known of him except that in the seventh century
Maximus the Confessor says that Aristo wrote the
Dialogus of Jason and Papiscus, which was mentioned
by Clement of Αlexandria, who seems to have attributed
it to Luke the Evangelist, though the text of
this statement may be corrupt. Ιt is therefore
possible that ΕusebiuS is merely referring to some
reference introduced into this lost Dialogue (see
Harnack, Altchritliche Literature, i. pp. 92 ffi).</p>
<p>Quadratus and Aristides.— Εusebius mentions
apologists of the reign of Hadrian — Quadratus and
Αristides. The work of Quadratus is lost, but the
apology of Aristides has been recently discovered,
though in an imperfect condition. Α Syriac translation
was found by J. Rendel Harris in 1889 on
Mount Sinai, and it was then recognized by J.
Αrmitage Robinson as extant in Greek in the speech
put into the mouth of the Christian Νachor in the
story of Barlaam and Josaphat. The Syriac and the
Greek differ widely, and it is disputed which of the
two is nearer the original. Both forms are given in
Rendel Ηarris’s “ The Αpology of Aristides ” in Texts
and Studies i. 1. The Syriac, which alone has the
of Apology, suggests that it was addressed to
Antoninus Pius rather than to Hadrian, but the text
is in any case corrupt and the point is not certain.
Ηarnack’s Altchristliche Literatur i. pp. 96 ff. and ii. 2.
pp. 271 ff. gives the best statement of the facts and
references to other books, but to these should be
added Geffckens's Zrvei griechische Apologien.</p>

<pb n="l"/>
<p>The Gnostic Writers. — In Hist. Eccl. iv. 7 and 11
Eusebius mentions the chief Gnostic writers known
to him. His information was apparently derived in
main from Irenaeus with probably some use of
Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus, and a lost work
(the Syntagma) of Justin Μartyr. The best modern
books introductory to the subject of Gnosticism are
those of Lipsius (especially his Quellen der ältesten
ketzergeschichten and his artieles in the Dictionary of
Christian Biography), Ηarnack’s Quellenkritik der Geschichte
des Gnosticismus, and and Faye's Gnosptiques et
Gnosticisme, but it is probably quicker and certainly
better to begin by reading Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and
— quite especially — the Excerpta Theodoti οf Clement
of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Justin Martyr. — Justin according to his own
account (at the beginning of his dialogus with
Trypho) was born in Samaria and became in his youth
a zealous but unsuccessful student of philosophy.
Ηe was converted to Christianity before Α. D. 135 (the
time to which the Dialogue refers) and died as a
martyr under Junius Rusticus, who was praetor under
Marcus Aurelius between 163 and 167. The Chronicon
Paschale fixes the year of his martyrdom as 165, and
there is no reason why this should not be correct.</p>
<p>According to Eusebius he wrote at least ten books,
of which he gives the list in Hist. Eccl. iv. 18. 2-9. Of
these two are extant (1) The Apology to Antoninus
Pius, and (2) The Dialogus with Trypho ; but there
is a curious literary puzzle in connexion with the
Αpοlogy. The printed texts of Justin (which represent
the Paris manuscript, Paris. 450 of the year 1364
of which all other manuscripts are copies) give two
aplogies of Justin, and Eusebius also states that he

<pb n="li"/>
wote two apοlogies. It would therefore be natural
tο. conclude that We possess the twο which Eusebids
had. But except in Hist. Εccl. iv. l6. 1 ff. which is
ambiguοus, Εusebius quotes as the first Αοlogy
passages from both the printed boοks. The pοint
has not been completely cleared up, but it seems
probable that the printed texts make up the Eusebian
Rrst apology and that the second οne known to
Εusebius has been lost.</p>
<p>Three other wοrks of Justin mentioned by Εusebius
purport tο be given in the printed texts—the Oratio
cοntra Graecos, the Cοhοrtatio ad Graecos, and the
Dε mοnarchia—but it is generally held that these texts
are spurious, and it is unlikely that they are those to
which Εusebius refers.</p>
<p>The best effition of Justin is that of Otto, 3rd
edition, l876. The best statements of the manuscripts
and the ecclesiastical tradition are by Ηarnack
in his Altchristliche literature i. pp. 99 ff., and ii. l ff.,
274 ff., and in the Texte und Untersuchungen I. i. 2.
The most eomplete discussion of Justin's teaching is
by Goodenough, Justin Martyr, 1928, which also
contains a very full bibliography.</p>
<p>Τhe Acts of the Martyrs.—Though ΕusebiuS was
active in cοllecting evidence as to the martyrdoms
of the earliest Christians, and made a collection of
documents describing them (see p. xiv) he has surprisingly
little to tell in his histοry. In the first five
bοοks he relates the martyrdom of James and Simeon,
the Lord’s brοthers, but his information is from
Ηegesippus; he also mentions the martyrdom of
Telesphorus, Bishop of Rome, Publius, Bishop of
Αthens, Ignatius of Αntioch, Justin, Ρtolemaeus,
Lucius, and Sagaris ; but he gives nο details and

<pb n="lii"/>
seems to have had no documents about them, though
the Acta of Justin are extant in a probably genuine
form. Ηe had the Acta of Polycarp, οf Pionius, of
Carpus, Ρapylus and Agathonice, and οf Apollonius
all of which are still extant, and the account οf th
martyrs of Lyons and Vienne, which has disappear
except for his extensive quotations at the beginni
of the fifth book.</p>
<p>Tatian.—The only work οf Tatian which is
in its original form is the Oratio ad Graecos, which was
once preserved in the famous Arethas manuscript
Paris 451 of the year Α.D. 914. The pages containing
Tatian's work are missing, but several later MSS.
are direct or indirect copies.</p>
<p>The Diatessaron of Tatian is not wholly lost.
There is an Arabic version, in which, however, the
text has been accommodated to the later Syrian text
of the Gospels ; there is some connexion between
it and the Ηarmοny found and edited by Victor of
Capua about the year 545 ; and it is possible that
some mediaeval Dutch and German harmonies
indicate the existence οf an Old Latin harmony
based on Tatian's works.1 Besides these, and in
many ways more important than these, are a series
οf quotations in early Syriac writers and the commentary
of Ephraim on the Diatessaron, partially preserved
in Armenian.</p>
<p>The best edition οf the Oratio ad Graecos is that of
E. Schwartz, and of the Diatessaron that given in the
Ante-Nicene Church Fathers. See also especially Zahn's
For schungen i. and the treatment of Tatian in his
Geschichte des N. T. Kanon.</p>

<pb n="liii"/>
<p>Writers in the time of Marcus Aurelius. — In Hist.
Eccl. iv. 20 f. Eusebius gives a list of the writers
οf the end of the second century : Theophilus of
Antioch, Hegesippus, Dionysius of Corinth, Pinytus
of Crete, Philip of Gortyna, Apollinarius of Hierapolis,
Melito, Musanus, Modestus, and Irenaeus. In
the following chapters he gives a short summary οf
the writings of each of them with the exception of
Irenaeus whom he reserves for the next book. Νοne
of these writings are extant except a few fragments
of Melito in Syriac, and the three books of Theophilus
Ad Autolycum, published in Otto's Corpus Apologeticum
cum and in other collections. The first printed edition
was issued at ürich in 1546. The facts relating to
Hegesippus have been dealt with above on p. xlvi.</p>
<p>Book V— In this book Εusebius deals first
the persecution of the Christians in the time of
Μarcus Aurelius, illustrating it by long quotations
from the letter of the churches of Lvons and Vienne
referred to above (p. lii). Ηe then describes the
works of Irenaeus, and Rhodo, and then turns to
Montaism, the Paschal controversy, and the heresy
of Artemon and the two Theodoti.</p>
<p>Irenaeus. — Irenaeus was probably a native οf the
province of Asia and in his youth saw Florinus and
Ρolycarp, presumably at Smyrna. Polycarp was put
to death in 155, so that Irenaeus can hardly have
been born much later than 140. Florinus became a
Gnostic about 190 ; he was probably a little older
than Irenaeus, who says that as a boy he had admired
his splendid position in the Emperor's court. Therefore,
unless Florinus was converted when quite old,
Irenaeus cannot have been born much earlier than

<pb n="liv"/>
140 —ten years seems the extreme of possibility, and
every year earlier than 140 becomes less and less likely.</p>
<p>It is unknown how or when he left Asia, but it is
certain that in 177, the year of the persecution at
Lyons and Vienne, he went to Rome with the report
of the churches on the martyrdom of some of their
members, and he is described as being at that time
a presbyter. Shortly after this he became Bishop
of Lyons, and supported the Asiatic side in the
Paschal controversy with Victor of Rom in 190.
Nothing certain is known of his death. Jerome (but
no earlier writer) speaks of him as a martyr. and it
has been thought that he was put to death in the
persecution of Septimius Severus in 202, but this is
merely a guess.</p>
<p>Of his many writings mentioned by Eusebius (see
especially Hist. Eccl. iv. 11, 20, 26) only two are
fully extant and neither in the original language.
The Πρὸς Αἱρέσεις or Ἔλεγχος καὶ ἀνατροπὴ τῆς
ψευδωνύμου γωώσεως,1 quoted as the Adversus Haereses,
is found in Latin ; the best edition is that of Ηarvey
(Cambridge, 1857). The Ἀπόδειξιε τοῦ ἀποστολικοῦ
κηρύγματος2 or Apostolic Preaching, a treatise sent
by Ιrenaeus to his friend Marcianus, is found in
Αrmenian and was published in 1907 in the Texte
und Unter suchungen, xxxi. 1.</p>
<p>Ρrobably the best description of the theology of
Irenaeus is not in any book devoed to him, but in
W. Bousset's Kyrios Christos.</p>
<p>The anti-Montainst Writers. — Ιn the fifth book, after
long extracts from the letter οf the Churches οf Lyons
and Vienne about their martyrs, and some extracts

from Irenaeus, Εusebius goes οn to describe the work
f Clement οf Alexandria (see above, pp. xilv-xlv)
d of Rhodo, οf whom nothing more is known, and
hen turns to a discussion of Montanism, or the
hrygian heresy. For this he makes use of five
urce, οf which unfortunately nothing more is
own beyond what he tells us himself. These are
pollinarius of Hierapolis, Apollonius, Serapion, an
οnymous writer who addressed a letter to Αbercius,
d either Miltiades or Αlcibiades. The Abercius
dressed by the anonymous writer is the centre of
one of the romances of epigraphy. In the Acta
nctorum for Octorber 22 is given a life οf Abercius,
hich has all the marks οf lateness, but it contains
epitaph which Lightfoot and others regarded as
nuine. Other scholars doubted this, but in 1883
W. M. Ramsay 1 discovered the epitaph in Hieropolis
not Hierapolis). The fifth document to which he
fers presents a curious puzzle as to its authorship,
r it is impossible to be sure what was the name of
e writer, as in the existing manuscripts Eusebius
early speaks οf Miltiades, but the source which he
uotes equally clearly speaks of Alcibiades. One
me or the other must be wrong, but there is no
fficient evidence for a choice between them (see
ist. Eccl. v. 17). For a discussion οf these docuents
and of οther evidence relating to Montanism
e best modern book is Ν. Bonwetsch's Montanisme.</p>
<p>The Paschal Controversy. — In Hist. Eccl. v. 27
usebius gives a short list of writers οf the beginning
the third century, but none of them have left
tant works. Ηe then goes οn to discuss the
aschale controversy. This dispute divided the Εast
<note type="footnote">1 See his Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, pp 424 ff.</note>

<pb n="lvi"/>
from the West. The Εast held that the fast
before Εaster Should end on the 14th οf Νisan (henc
the name “ Quartodecimans ’’) with the feast of the
resurrection following at once independently of the
day of the week, while the West followed the pres
custom οf observing the feast of the Resurrecti
on a sunday independently οf the day of the mon
and arranged the end of the fast accordingl
Eusebius quotes Polycrates of Ephesus, wh
writings are not now extant, and Irenaeus,
mentions various synods whose decrees were kn
to him but have since been lsot. For a discussi
of the action οf Victor of Rome, and οf the whole
question see Hefele's History of the
ferably in the Freneh translation which has many
valuable additional notes.</p>
<p>The Heresy of Artemon. — The last Ρart οf the fi
book is largely taken up with an anonymous quo
tion from a work against the Adoptionist teaching
Artemon and the two Theodoti, whose teaching th
Jesus was a man who by the power of God bec
divine is sometimes described by modern writers
“ Dynamic Monarchianis,” Theodoret, who
used this writing, says that it was called the “ Lit
Labyrinth,” obviously in allusion to the
Hippolytus against heresy, which is sometim
called “ The Labyrinth.” Modern scholars
think that the “ Little Labyrinth ’’ was itself
work of Hippolytus but this is by no means certain.</p>
<p>For further information as to these οr any ot
writers mentioned by Eusebius, the best and clear
guides are Harnach's Geschichte der
Litteratur, Bardenhewer's Geschichte der
Literatur, and the Dictionary of Christian Biography.</p>

<p>THE ECCLESIASTICAL
HISTORY OF EUSEBIUS</p>
<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>I. I. HAVE purposed to record in writing the successions
οf the sacred apostles, covering the period stretching
from our Saviour to ourselves ; the number add
character of the transactions recorded in the history
οf the Church ; the number of those who were distinguished
in her government and leadership in the
provinces οf greatest fame ; the number of those
who in each generation were the ambassadors of
the word of God either by speech οr pen ; the names,
the number and the age of those who, driven by
the desire of innovation to an extremity of error,
have heralded themselves as the introducers of
Knowledge, falsely so-called, ravaging the flock of
Christ unsparingly, like grim wolves. To this I
will add the fate which has beset the whole nation
οf the Jews from the moment of their plot against
οur saviour ; moreover, the number and nature
and times οf the wars waged by the heathen against
the divine word 1 and the character οf those who,
for its sake, passed from time to time through
the contest οf blood and torture ; furthermore the

starting-point is therefore no other than the first
dispensation of God touching our Saviour and Lord,
Jesus the Christ. Even at that point the project
at once demands the lenience of the kindly, for confessedly
it is beyond our power to fulfil the promise,
complete and perfect, since we are the first to enter
on the undertaking, as travellers on some desolate
and untrodden way. We pray God to give us his
guidance, and that we may have the help of the
power of the Lord, for nowhere can we find even
the bare footsteps of men who have preceded us
in the same path, unless it be those slight indications
by which in divers ways they have left to us partial
accounts of the times through which they have
passed, raising their voices as a man holds up a torch
from afar, calling to us from on high as from a distant
watch-tower, and telling us how we must walk,
and how to guide the course of our work without
error or danger. We have therefore collected from
their scattered memoirs all that we think will be
useful for the present subject, and have brought
together the utterances of the ancient writers themselves
that are appropriate to it, culling, as it were,
the flowers of intellectual fields. We shall endeavour
to give them unity by historical treatment, rejoicing
to rescue the successions, if not of all, at least of
the most distinguished of the apostles of our Saviour
throughout those ehurches of which the fame is
still remembered. To work at this subject Ι consider
especially necessary, because I am not aware

that any Christian 1 writer has until now paid
attention to this kind of writing ; and I hope that
its high value will be evident to those who are
convinced of the importance of a knowledge of the
history. Ι have already summarized the material
in the chronological tables which I have drawn up,
but nevertheless in the present work I have undertaken
to give the narrative in full detail.</p>
<p>Ι will begin with what, apprehended in relation
to Christ, is beyond man in its height and greatness,
— the dispensation of God, and the ascription of
divinity.2 For he who plans to hand on in writing
the history of Christian origins is forced to begin
from the first dispensation concerning the Christ
himself, which is more divine than it seems to
most, seeing that from him we claim to derive our
very name.</p>
<p>II. Now his nature was twofold ; on the one hand
like the head of the body, in that he is recognized as
God, on the other comparable to the feet, in that he
put on for the sake of our own salvation, man of like
passions with us. Therefore to make our description
of what follows complete we should start the
whole narrative concerning him by the most capital
and dominant points of the discussion. By this
means, moreover, the real antiquity and divine
character of Christianity will be equally demonstrated
to those who suppose that it iS recent and
foreign, appearing no earlier than yesterday.</p>
<note type="footnote">2 οἰκονομία and θεολογία are semi-technical terms. The
οἰκονομία or “ dispensation ’’ with regard to Christ was the
incarnation of the divine Logos ; the θεολογία was the
ascription of divinity to him. Hence this passage might
almost be rendered freely as “ the divine and human natures
οf Christ, which pass man's understanding."</note>

<p>No treatise, indeed, could be sufficient for a statement
of the origin and dignity, the very bei
nature of the Christ : as indeed the divine spirit
says in prophecies, “ who will declare his generation
? ’’ seeing that neither does any know the
Father save the son, neither did any ever know the
son properly, save οnly the Father who begat him.
nd who except the Father would ever clearly
conceive the ante-mundane light, and that wisdom
which was intellectual and real 1 before the ages,
the living Logos who was, in the beginning, God
by the side of the Father, the first and only offspring
οf God, before all creation and fabrication,2 both
visible and invisible, the captain of the spiritual and
immortal host of heaven, the angel of great counsel,
the minister οf the ineffable plan of the Father,
the fabricator οf all things along with the Father,
the true and only begotten child of God, the Lord
and God and King of all begotten, Who has received
lordship and might together with deity itself, and
power and honour from the Father, according to the
mysterious ascription of divinity to him in the Scriptures,
“ In the beginning was the Logos and the
Logos was with God and the Logos was God, all
things were through him, and without him was no
single thing ’’ ? This, indeed, is also the teaching
of the great Moses, as the most ancient of all prophets,
when by divine inspiration he described the
coming into being, and the ordering of the universe,
that the creator and fabricator of all things gave
up to the Chirst himself, and to no other than his

divine and first-born Logos, the making οf subordinate
thinks and communed with him concerning
the creation of man. “ For,” he says, “ God
let us make man in our own image and likeness.”
Αnοther of the prophets confirms this saying, ascribing
divinity to him in one place in hymns, “ Ηe
spake and they were begotten, he commanded and
they were ” 1 On the one hand he intro-
duces the Father and Maker as a universal sovereign,
commanding by his royal nod, and on the other
the divine Logos — no other than him who is proclaimed
by us — as secondary to him, and ministering
to his Father's commands. Him even from
creation of mankind did all who are said to have
heen pre-eminent in righteousness and virtuous
piety recognize by the contemplation of the pure
eyes of the mind, and pay him the reverence
due to a child of God ; thus did Moses, the great
servant, and his fellows, and even before him
Abraham, the first, and his children, and all the
righteous and prophets who have since appeared ;
and he himself, never wearying of piety toward
the Father, has been a teacher to all men of knowledge
of the Father. Thus the Lord God is said
to have appeared as an ordinary man to Abraham,
while he was seated by the oak of Mamre. But
he fell down immediately, even though he saw him
as a man with his eyes, worshipped him as God,
besought him as Lord, and confessed that he was
not ignorant who he was saying in his own words,
<note type="footnote">“word” as meaning Logos, and thus connects the “ he ’’
οf the verse which he actually quotes with the Logos, not
the Father. This was a traditional Christian interpretation
and was probably so familiar to Eusebius that he overlooked
his omission of the connecting link in the argument.</note>

“O Lord, that judgest all the earth, wilt thou not
do judgement ? ’’ For inasmuch as no reason would
allow that the uncreated and unchangeable substance
οf the Almighty was converted into the form
of man, or deceived the eyes of the beholders by
the phantasm of anything created, or that the Scripture
has falsely invented such a story, who other
could be described as God, and as the Lord who
judges all the earth and does judgement, appearing
in the form of man (seeing that it is improper to
call him the first cause of the universe), than his
pre-existent Logos alone ? Αnd concering him it
was said in the Psalms, “ Ηe sent forth his Logos
and healed them, and he rescued them from their
corruptions.” Of him, too, Μoses clearly
as a second Lord, after the Father, when he says,
“ The Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone
and fire from the Lord. ” Him the divine
Scripture also calls God when he appears in human
form to Jacob, saying to Jacob, “ Thy name shall
no more be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy
name because thou hadst power with God. ” Then,
too, “ Jacob called the name οf the place ‘the Vision
of God,’ saying, ‘ For I saw God face to face
my life was saved.’ ’’ 1 Αnd it cannot be right
suppose that the Theophanies described were the
appearances of subordinate angels and ministers of
God, for whenever οne οf these appears to men the
scripture does not conceal it, but says definitely
that they are called angels, not God or Lord, as
it is easy to prove from countless passages. Ηim,
too, Joshua, the successor of Moses, calls the chief

the Logos and Wisdom of God, can be learned from
he actual person of Wisdom herself, in addition to
the preceding proofs, for in one place she tells her
own secret very clearly through Solomon, “ Ι, Wisdom,
made Counsel my habitation and I invoked Knowledge
and Thought ; through me kings reign, and
the mighty inscribe justice ; by me great men are
magnified, and sovereigns rule the earth through
me.” Αnd to this she adds, ‘‘ The Lord created
as the beginning of his ways for his works ; he
established me before the world ; in the beginning,
before the making of the earth, before the springs
οf water came forth, before the mountains were
founded, and before all hills, he begat me. When
he prepared the heaven, I was present with him,
and when he made safe the springs which are
under heaven, I was with him giving them order.
I was she in whom he rejoiced daily and I exulted
before him at all times, when he exulted that he
bad completed the world.” Thus let this be
short proof that the divine Logos pre-existed, and
appeared to some, if not to all, men.</p>
<p>It must now be demonstrated why this announcement
was not formerly made, long ago, to all men
and all nations, as it is now. The life of men in the
past was not capable οf receiving the complete
wisdom and virtue of the teaching of Christ. For
at the beginning, after the first life in blessedness,
the first man, despising the command of God, fell
at once to this mortal and perishable life, and
exchanged the former divine delights for this earth

the Father, and that the marvel of his birth and his
new teaching and the wonder of his deeds will be
made manifest together with the manner of his
death and resurrection from the dead, and, above
all, his divine restoration to Heaven. Daniel the
prophet, in a moment of inspiration, saw by the
divine spirit his final sovereignty, and describes the
vision of God in human wise : “ For I beheld,”
said, “ until thrones were set and an Ancient of
Days did sit. Αnd his garment was white like
snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool ;
his throne was a flame of fire, his wheels were
flaming fire, a river of fire ran before him, thousand
thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before him, the judgement
sat, and books were ” Αnd he goes on to
say, “ I beheld, and lo, one like to a son of man
coming with the clouds of Heaven, and he came to
the Ancient of Days and was brought before him.
Αnd to him was given the sovereignty and honour
and kingdom, and all the people, tribes, and tongues
shall serve him. His power is an everlasting power,
which shall not pass away, and his kingdom shall
not be destroyed.” Clearly this would apply
none but our Saviour, the God-Logos who was in
the beginning with God, called “ son of man ’’
because of his ultimate incarnation. However,

he promoted to a kingdom by the armed force οf
men, nor did he become a prophet in the same way
as those οf οld, nor did he hold any rank at all or
precedence among the Jews, yet with all these he
had been adorned, not in symbols, but in actual
reality by the Father. Though he did not obtain
the honours οf which we have spoken before, he is
called Christ more than any of them, and inasmuch
as he is himself the only true Christ of God, he filled
the whole world with Christians — his truly reverend

types or images but the uncovered virtues themselves
and the heavenly life, in the actual doctrines
οf truth, and he has received the chrism, not that
which is prepared materially 1 but the divine anointing
itself with the spirit of God, by sharing in the unbegotten
divinity of the Father. Again, Isaiah teaches
this very point, for in one place he exclaims as if
from Christ himself, “ The spirit of the Lord was

to preach the gospel to the poor, to announce release

divine power, to present him in the third place
as having become Christ, anointed not with oil
ade of material substances but with the divine
“ οil οf gladness.” Αnd in addition to this
dicates his peculiar distinction and superiority
to those who in the past had been more materially
anointed as types.1 And in another plaee too the
same David explains his position as follows : “ The
Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
until I make thine enemies the footstool of thy
eet.” Αnd, “ Before the day-star I begat
from the womb. The Lord sware and will not repent,
ou art a priest for ever after the οrder of Melchisedek.”
Νοw this Melchisedek is introduced in
he sacred books as priest of the most high God,
ithout having been so marked out by any material
ction, or even as belonging by racial descent to
e priesthood οf the Ηebrews. For this reason οur
aviour has been called Christ and priest, on the
uthority of an οath, according to his order and not
according to that of the others Who received symbols
nd types. For this reason, too, the narrative does
ot relate that he was anointed physically by the
ews or even that he was or the tribe of those who
old the priesthood, but that he received his being

y, before the construction οf the world, and holds
is priesthood to boundless eternity, ageless and

the whole whole; that under this title he is confessed
and borne witness to by all, and is mentioned
thus by Jews, Greeks, and barbarians; that until
is present day he is honoured honoured by his worshippers
throughout the world as king, wondered at more
an a Ρrophet, and glorified as the true and only
High Priest οf God, and, above all, as the Logos of
God, pre-existent, having his being before all ages,
and having received the right οf reverence from
the Father, and that he is worshipped as God.
Strangest of all, we who have been consecrated to
him, honour him not οnly with our voices and with
the sound of words, but with the whole disposition
of our soul, so as to value testimony to him more
than our very life itself.</p>

before beginning the history, that no one might
think or our Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, as a
novelty because of the date of his ministry in the

together by a youth no better than the rest of men,
come, let us discuss this point briefly. For when
the advcnt of our Saviour, Jesus Christ, reeently
shone forth on all men, it was confessedly a new
race which has thus appeared in such numbers, in
accordance with the ineffable prophecies of the date,
and is honoured by all by the name of Christ, but
it is not little nor weak, nor founded in some obscure
corner οf the earth, earth, but the most populous of all
and invincible in that it ever finds help from God.</p>

It was at this that one of the prophets was amazed
when, by the eye of the divine spirit, he foresaw the
future which was to be, so that he exclaimed, “Who
heard these things and who spoke thus? Did the
earth travail in one day, and was a nation born at
once ?” Αnd the same writer also indicates in one
place its future title, saying, “Αnd a new name shall
be called on those who serve me, which shall be blessed
on the earth.” But even if we are clearly new,
and this really fresh name of Christians is recently
known among all nations, nevertheless our life and
method of conduet, in accordanee with the precepts
of religion, has not been recently invented by us,
but from the first creation of man, so to speak, has
been upheld by the natural concepts of the men
of old who were the friends of God, as we will here
demonstrate. The race of the Hebrews is not new
and is itself well known to all. Now, stories and
documents belonging to it concern ancient men,
few and scarce in number, yet remarkable for piety
and righteousness and for all other virtues. Divers
οf them, indeed, were before the flood, and after it
were others, and, (to say nothing of the children
and descendants of Νoah), especially Αbraham,
whom the children of the Hebrews boast as their
οwn originator and ancestor. If the line be traced
back from Αbraham to the first man, anyone who
should describe those who have obtained a good
testimony for righteousness, as Christians in fact,

if not in name, would not shoot wide of the truth.
Fοr the name signifies that through the knowledge
of Christ and his teaching the Christian man excels
sobriety and righteousness, in control of life and
courageous virtue, and in the confession that God
ver all is but one; and for zeal in all this they
are not inferior to us. They had no care for bodily
circumcision any more than we, nor for the keekping
Sabbaths any more than we, nor for abstinenee <lb n="1"/>
from certain foods nor the distinction between others
(such as Moses afterwards first began to hand down
their successors) nor for symbolic ceremony any
more than christians care for such things now, but
they clearly knew him as the Christ of God, seeing
at it has aheady been demonstrated that he
peared to Αbraham, addressed Isaac, spoke to
srael, and conversed with Moses and the later
prophets. Whence you would find that those Godlving
men obtained even the name οf Christ accordto
the word spoken concerning them, “ Touch
not my Christs and act not wickedly among my prophets.”
So that it must cleariy be held that the
announcement to all the Gentiles, recently made
through the teaching of Christ, is the very first
and most aneient and antique discovery of true
religion by Αbraham and those lovers of God who
followed him. Αnd even if they say that Αbraham
it has been related that, before this command, he
received a good testimony for righteousness through
faith, as the divine word says, “Αnd Αbraham be-

Αnd to him, just as he was, before circumcision,
was the oraele given by the God who showed
himself to him (and this was the Christ himself, the
word of God), concerning those who in time to come
would be justified in the same manner as himself,
in the following promise, “ Αnd in thee shall all the
tribes of the earth be ” and, “ It shall be a
great and numerous nation, and all the nations of
the earth shall be blessed in ” Νow this is
obviously intelligible as fulffiled in us ; for it was
by faith towards the Logos of God, the Christ who
had appeared to him, that he was justified, and
gave up the superstition οf his fathers, and his
rmer erroneous life, and confessed the God who
is over all to be one ; and him he served by virtuous
deeds, not by the worship of the law of Moses,
ho eame later. To him, just he was then, was
t said that all the tribes of the earth and all the
nations 1 will be blessed in him ; and more clearly than
auy words do faets show that at the present moment
it is only among Christians throughout the whole
world that the manner of religion which was
braham's can actually be found in practice. What
bjection then can there be to admitting that the
fe and pious conduct of us, who belong to Christ,
and οf the God-loving men οf old is one and the same?
us we have demonstrated that the practice of

a Roman general, attacked Jerusalem, besieged it
in force, and demed the holy places by intruding
into the secret parts of the temple. Ηe sent to
Rome as a prisoner with his children the king and
high priest, Aristobulus by name, who had contunued
the succession of his ancestors until then.
To Hyrcanus, the brother of Aristobulus, he handed
over the high-priesthood, but made the whole nation
οf the Jews from that time tributary to the Romans.
As soon as Hyrcanus, the last to whom belonged
the high-priestly succession, was taken prisoner by
the Parthians, Ηerοd, the Rrst foreigner, as I just

confusion naturally ensued in the affairs οf the priesthood

known to be actually the children of the living one. This
happened in the ease of Joseph. He was legally the son of
Eli, physically of Jacob. Α further complication was that
EIi and Jacob were only half brothers. They were the sons
of the same mother, Estha, but Eli was the son of her second

by law, when a man begat children in the name of

passed away might not fail to remain. since them

Were reckoned in name to one father though the

the one descended from Solomon and tlle other from
Νathan, Were connected with each other by the
‘ resurrections’ 1 of the childless and second
marriages and the rairing up of seed, so that the

children of different persons at different times, either

the end iS found to be Matthan who begat Jacob
the father of Joseph; but from Νathan, the son οf
David, according to Luke, the corresponding
from the end is Melchi; for Joseph as a son or
Εli the son of Melchi. So then fixing our attention
on Joseph, it must be demonstrated how each is
called hiS father, Jaeob traeing his family from
Solomon and Eli from Nathan, and how first they,
that is Jaeob and Eh, were tWo brothers, and, still
earlier, how their fathers, Matthan and Melchi,
belonging to different families, are represented as
the grandfathers or Joseph. Now Mathan and
Melchi, inasmuch as they took the same wife, were
the fatherS of step-brothers, for the law doeS not
prevent a woman who has lost her husband either by
her own divorce or by his death from being married
to another. Now from Estha, ror this is the traditional
name of the Woman, first Mattan, who
reekoned his deseent from solomon, begat Jaeob
and when Μatthan was dead, Melchi, who traced
himself by family to Νathan, took his widow, for he
was of the same tribe though of another family,
as I said before, and had a son, Eli. Thus We shall
find that though the two families were different
Jaeob and Eli were step-brothers of the same mother,
and the Brst of them, Jacob, when his brother Eli
died without children, took his wife, and begat of
her the third, 1 Joseph, according to nature, for
himself (and so also according to reason, for which
cause it is written, ‘ And Jacob begat Joseph’),

seed. Wherefore the genealogy concerning him
will not be inaccurate. Matthew, the evangelist,
reckoned it in this way, saying, ‘ Αnd Jacob begat
’ but Luke, on the other hand, said, ‘Who
waS, aS it was supposed’ (for he addS this
‘ the son of Joseph, the son of Eli, the son of Melchi,’
for if was impossible to eXpress legal descent more
pointedly, and up to the end he suppressed the
word ‘ begat ’ concerning sueh raising of children, for
he traces the list back to its Source with Αdam
the Son of God.’ This is neither deVoid of
nor is it conjecture, for the human relatives of the
Saviour have handed on this tradition, either from
family pride, or merely to give information, but in
any case speaking the truth. When Idumaean
brigands attacked the city of Ascalon in Palestine
among their other spoils they took away captive
from the temple of Αpollo, which Was built on the
walls, Antipater the child of a certain Herod, a
hierodoulos, and since the priest was unable to pay
ransom for his son, Antipater was brought up in
the customs of the Idumaeans and later was befriended
friended by Hyrcanus the high priest of Judaea.
When sent on a mission to Ρompey on behalf of
Hyrcanus he Won for him the freedom of the kingdom
which had been taken away by his brother Aristobulus,
and so was himself fortunate enough to gain
the title of overseer of Palestine. Antipater was
assassinated from envy of his great good fortune,
and succeeded by a son Ηerod, 1 who later was
appointed by Antony and by decree of the august
senate to be king of the Jews. His children were
Ηerod 2 and the other tetrarchs. So much is shared

noticing in this connexion the result of the crime
of Ηerod against the Christ and the children of his

the justice of God overtook him while he was still in

he had passed hence. It is not now possible even to

Ηerοd : he paid a just penalty for the children that
he murdered at Bethlehem foi the sake of his plot
against our saviour. Αfter this an angel appeared
in a dream to Joseph, who was stying in Egypt, and
commanded him to return to Judaea with the child
and his mother, and announeed that those who sought
the life οf the little child were dead. The evangelist
continues by saying, “ Νοw when he heard that
Archelaus was king in the room οf Herod his father,
he was afraid to depart there, and, being warned in
a dream, retired to the ffistriets of Galilee.”</p>

thc aceession to power of Archelaus after Herod,
describing both the way in which he succeeded to
the kingdom of the jews by the testaments of
Ηerod his father and the deeision of Caesar Augustus,
and how, when he fell from power after ten years,

who recently or formerly have issued a series of
Pilate's Reports 1 about our Savious; for in them
the dates mentioned convict the forgers of untruth.
They relate that the crime of the Saviour's death
fell in the fourth consulship of Tiberius, which
as the seventh year of his reign, but at that time
it has been shown that Pilate was not yet in charge
of Judaea, if Josephus may be used as a witness,
for he clearly shows, in the writing quoted from him
above, that it was aetually in the twelfth year of the
reign of Tiberius that Pilate was appointed procurator
of Judaea by Tiberius.</p>

the evangelist, when Tiberius Caesar was in the
fifteenth year of his reign and Pontius Pilate the
fourth of his governorship, and Herod, Lysanias, and
Philip were tetrarchs of the rest of Judaea, our Saviour
and Lord, Jesus the Christ of Good, “ beginning to
be about thirty years old” came to the baptism of

then, he began in the high priesthood of Annas
and continued to the reign of Caiaphas the intervening
time does not not to a full four years.
For since the regulations of the law were at that
time already in process of destruction the rule had
been relaxed by which the duties of the service of
God were held for life and by inherited succession,
and the Roman goversors entrusted the high priesthood
at different times to different men, who did not
hold this office for more than one year. Moreover
Josephus relates that four high priests intervened in
succession between Annas and Caiaphas, and speaks
as follows in the text of the Antiquities:</p>
<p>“Valerius Gratus, having deprived Ananus of the
priesthood, as as high Ρriest Ishmael the
son of Phabi. Ηim, too, he removes shortly and
nominates as high priest Eliezer thc son or Ananus
the high priest. But when a year vas past he
removes him also and hands over the high priesthood
to Simon the son of Kamithus. But neither
did his tenure of office last for more than a year,

our saviour is shown to be not even a full four years ;
sinee from Αnnas to the appointment of Caiaphas

cated eaiaphas as high priert of the year in which the
Saviours's pasrion was completed, and from this also

mean that John was preaching to ascetics and suggested
baptism as a hnal act of perfection. This explains the reference
to “ when the rest collected.” So long as
preached to ascetics Herod did not mind but was disturbed

her, being condemned to live in Vienne, a eity of

eighteenth book of the Antiquities, where he writes
concerning John exactly as follows :</p>
<p>“Νow to some ofthe Jews it seemed that the army
of Ηerod had been destroyed by OOd and that he was
paying a very just penalty for John who was called
the Baptist. For Ηerod killed him, a good man and
one who commanded the Jews, training themselves
in virtue, to pracrise righteousness towards one
another and piety towards God, and to come together
for baptism. For he said that baptism would prove
acceptable to him only in those who used it not to
escape from any sins but for bodily purity, on condition
that the soul also had been previously cleansed
thoroughly by righteousness. Αnd when the rest
collected, for they were greariy eXeited at hearing his
vords, Herod feared hiS great persuasiveness with
men lest it should lead to some rising, for they
appeared ready to do everything under his advice.
Ηe therefore eonsidered it mUeh better, beffire a
revolt should spring from John, to put him to death
in anticipation, rather than be involved in difficulties
through the actual revolution and then regret it.
Αnd John, through Herod's suspicion, was sent a
prisoner to Macherus, the prison mentioned already,
and was there put to death.”</p>

as the apostle Ρeter. Traffition also relates that
Μatthias, who was reckoned with the apostle in

him at the same casting of lots had been called
among the Seventy. They also say that Thaddaeus
was one or them, and I will shortly recount a narrative
which has reaehed us concerning him. Αnd
eonsideration would show yoll that there Were more
diseiples of the saviour than the seventy, if you used
Ρaul as a witness, for he says that arter the resurrection
from the dead Jesus was seen first by Cephas,
afterwards by the twelve, and after these by above
five hundred brethren at once ; of whom he says
that some had fallen asleep, but the majority remained
alive at at tlle time that he composed this
account. He says that he was then seen by James,
who was one of the alleged brethren of the Saviour,
and then, as though in addition to these there had
been numberless apostles, on the model of the
twelve, like Ρaul himself, he goes on to say “ then
he was seen by all the apostles.” This then
for them.</p>

were far remote from Judaea, in the hope of healing
from diseases and from ah kinds of sufferings. In

suffering in his body, beyond human power to heal,
when he heard much of the name οf Jesus and of the
miracles attested unanimously by all men, became
his suppliant and sent to him by the bearer of a
letter, asking to find relief from his disease. Jesus
did not give heed to his request at the time, yet
vouehsafed him a letter of his own, promising to
send one of his disciples for the cure of his disease,
and for the salvation alike of himself and of all his

aviour who has appeared in the district of Jerusalem,
eeting. I have heard. . concerning you and your
ures, how they are accomprlshed by you without
ugs and herbs. For, as the story goes, you make
he blind recover their sight, the lame walk, and
hu cleanse lepers, and cast out unclean sspirits and
emons, and you cure those who are tortured by long
isease and you raise dead men. Αnd when 1 heard
these things concerning you I decided that it is one
the two, either that you are God, and came down
οm heaven to do these things, or are a son of God
οr doing these things. For this reason I write to beg
ou to hasten to me and to heal the suffering which
Ι have. Moreover I heard that the Jews are
mocking you, and wish to ill-great you. Now I
have a city very small and venerable which is
enough for both.” 1</p>

courier Ananias.</p>
<p>“Blessed art thou who didst believe in me not

not preriously tested the matter, for an ancient law
prevailed that no οne should be held as a God by

the Romans rejected the report sent to it concerning
οur sariour, but Tiberius kept the opinion which he
had fonnerly held and made no wicked plans against
the teaching οf Christ.</p>
<p>Tertullian, who had an accurate knowledge of
Roman law, a man espeeially famous among those
most distinguished in Rome, has noted this in the
Apology for the christians which was written by
him in Latin but translated into the oreek language;
he tells the story as follows: “ But, in order that
we may ffiscuss sueh laws from their origin, there
an an ancient decree that none should be con-
secrated as a god by an Εmperor before being
approved by the senate. Marcus Aemilius has acted
thus conceming a certain idol Αlbumus. Αnd this
supports our argument that among you godship has
been given by human approval. If a god does not
Ρlease man, he does not hecome god, so that, according
to this, man must be gracious to Ood. Tiberius,
therefore, in whose time the name of Christian came
into the World, when this doctrine was reported to
him from Ρalestine, where it Rrst began, communh
cated it to the Senate, and made it plain to them
that he favoured the doctrine, but the senate, because
it had not itself tested it, rejected it; but he continued
in his own opinion and threatened death to
the accusers of the ”1 For heavenly

order that the word of the Oospel might have an

Tiberius, in the city ofthe Romans, Sejanus, the most
influential of the Emperor's court at the time, took
measures eompletely to destroy the whole race, and
in Judaea Ρilate, under whom the crime against the
saviour was perpetrated, made an attempt on the
temple, still standing in Jerusalem, contrary to the
privileges granted to the JeWs, and harassed them tO
the utmost, (VI.) whhe arter the death Of Tiberius
Caius reeeived the sovereignty and inffieted many
injuries on many, but more than all did the greatest
harm to the vhole nation of the Jews. This may
be learned shOrtly from his own word, in which he
writes exactly as follows: “ Now the eharaeter of Caius

towards the raee of Jews. Ηe hated them bitteriy bitterly:

<p>The same writer narrates in a second treaties
entitled Οn the Virtues1 innumerable other atrocities,
beyond all description, perpectrated on Jews
in Alexandria in the same reign, and Josephus
comfirms him, showing in the same Way that rile
universal misfortunes of the nation began with the
time οf Pilate and the crimes against the Saviour.
Listen then to the actural words of his statement in
the second book of the Jewish War. “ Now Pilate.
sent as procurator to Judaea by Tiberius, brought
into Jerusalem at night and covered up the images
of Caesar which are called ensigns. When day
came this roused the greatest commotion among
the Jews, for they were horrified at what they
saw close by since their laws had been trampled
om, for they do not permit any image to be set up
in the city.”</p>
<p>Now comparing this with the writing of the Gospels
you will see that it was not long before they Were overtaken
by the ery vhieh they uttered in the presence of
Pilate himself, with Which they rilOuted Out that they
had no other king than Caesar only. The same writer

then goes on to relate another misfortune which
οvertook them, as follows: “ Αnd after this he
roused another commotion by expenffing the sacred
treasure, called Corban, for an aqueduet which he
brought from a ffistance οf three hundred stadia.
Popular indignation was aroused at this, and when
Pilate came to Jerusalem the Ρeople stood round
with howh of exeeration; but he had foreseen their
ffidIsturbance and had mixed with the crowd armed
soldiers disguised in civilian clothes, with orders not
to use their swords but to club those who had shouted.
Ηe gave the signal for this from his judgement-seat;
and as the Jews were smitten many perished
from the blows, many from being trampled upon
hy their fellows in their ffight, and the mob,
οvercome at the calamity οf those who perished,
was silent.”</p>
<p>The same writer shoWs that besides this innumerable
other revolts were started in Jerusalem
itseK, affirming that from that time risngs and war
and the mutual contrivance of eril never ceased
in the city and throughout Judaea, until the time
when the siege under vespasian came upon them as
the last scene of all. Thus the penalty of Ood
pursued the Jews for their crimes against Christ.</p>
<p>VII. it is also worthy of notice that tradition relates
that that same pilate, he οf the Saviour's time, in
the days of Caius, whose Ρeriοd we have described,
fell into such great calamity that he was forced to
become his own slayer and to punish himself with
his οwn hand, for the Ρenalty of God, as it seems,

<p>This is what Justin says, and Irenaeus agrees
with him in the first book against heresies where he
collects the stories about Simon and his unholy and
foul teaching. It would be superfluous to relate this
in the present work since those who desire it can
study in detail the origin and life and the false
doctrinal principles of the heresiarchs who followed
him and the customs introduced by them all, for

life, have in no way improved on the idolatrous
superstition from which they thought to be set free,

baseness and unspeakable conduct that they cannot
even be mentioned by the lips of decent men. For
whatever foulness might be conceived beyond all
that is base, it is surpassed by the utter foulness of
the heresy of these men, who make a mocking sport
of wretched women, “ weighed ” as is truly said,
by every kind of evil. XIV. of such evil was Simon
the father and fabricator, and the Evil Power,
which hates that which is good and plots against the
salvation of men, raised him up at that time as a
great antagonist for the great and inspired Apostles
of our Saviour. Nevertheless the grace of God
which is from heaven helped its ministers and
quickly extinguished the flames of the Evil One by
their advent and presence, and through them
humbled and cast down “ every high thing that
exalteth itself against the knowledge of God.”
Wherefore no conspiracy, either of Simon, or of any
other of those who arose at that time, succeeded in
those Apostolic days ; for the light of the truth and
the divine Logos himelf, which had shone from God
upon men by growing up on the earth and dwelling
among his own Apostles, was overcoming all things
in the might of victory. The aforesaid sorcerer, as
though the eyes of his mind had been smitten by
the marvellous effulgence of God when he had
formerly been detected in his crimes in Judaea by
the Apostle Peter, at once undertook a great journey
across the sea, and went off in flight from east to
west, thinking that only in this way could he live
as he wished. He came to the city of the Romans,

of Claudius the Providence of the universe in its

Rome, as against a gigantic pest on life, the great
and mighty Peter, who for his virtues was the leader
of all the Other Apostles. Like a noble captain of
God, clad in divine armour, he brought the costly
merchandise of the spiritual light from the east to
the dwellers in the west, preaching the Gospel of

zeal, and ratified the scripture for study in the
churches. Clement quotes the story in the sixth
book of the Hypotyposes, and the bishop of Hierapolis,
named Papias, confirms him. Ηe also says that
Peter mentions Μark in his first Epistle, and that he
composed this in Rome itself, which they say that
he himself indicates, referring to the city metaphorically
as Babylon, in the words, “ the elect one in
Babylon greets you, and Marcus my son.”</p>
<p>XVI. They Say that this Μark was the first to be
sent to preach in Egypt the Gospel which he had
also put into writing, and was the first to establish
churches in Alexandria itself. The number of men
and women who were there converted at the first
attempt was so great, and their asceticism was so
extraordinarily philosophic, that Philo thought it
right to describe their conduct and assemblies and
meals and all the rest of their manner of life. XVII.
Tradition says that he came to Rome in the time
of Claudius to speak to Peter, who was at that time
preaching to those there. This would, indeed, be
not improbable since the treatise to which we refer,
composed by him many years later, obviously contains
the rules of the Church which are still observed
in our own time. Moreover, from his very accurate
description of the life of our ascetics it will be plain
that he not only knew but welcomed, reverenced,
and recognized the divine mission of the apostolic
men of his day, who were, it appears, of Hebrew
origin, and thus still preserved most of the ancient

barbarism should share in perfect good, but it
abounds in Εgypt in each of the so-ealled nomes and

for their purpose, as though it were the land of the

Mareia 1 on a low hill, very convenient for its safety
and the temperateness οf the climate." Ηe then
goes on to describe the nature οf their dwellings,

“ In eaeh house there is a sacred dwelling whieh is
called ‘ a sanctuaq and , ' whieh they
celebrate in seclusion the mysteries of the sacred
life, and bring nothing into it, either drink or food

to eve is for them a religious exercise ; they study
the sacred scriptures and expound their national
philosophy by allegory, for they regard the literal
interpretation as symbolic of a concealed reality
indicated in what is beneath the surface. They
have also some writings of men of old, who were
the founders of their seet, who left many memorials
οf the meaning allegorically expounded, which they
use as models and copy their method of treatment.</p>
<p>This seems to have been said by a man who had
listened to their expositions of the sacred scriptures,
and it is perhaps probable that the writings of men
of old, whieh he says were found among them, were
the Gospels, the writings of the Apostles, and some
expositinos οf prophets after the manner of the
ancients, sueh as are in the Εpistle to the Ηebrews
and many οther of the epistles of Ρaul. Ηe then
goes on to write thus about their composition οf new
psahns : “ So that they not οnly contemplate but
make songs and hymns to God in all kinds of metres
and melodies, though they perforce arrange them
in the more sacred measures."</p>
<p>Ηe discusses many οther points as well in the
same book, but it seemed necessary to enumerate
those by whieh the charaeteristics of the life of the
Church are exhibited; but if anyone doubt that what
has been said is peculiar to life according to the
gospel, and think that it can be applied to others
besides those indicated, let him be persuaded by the
following words of Philo in which he will find, if he
be fair, indisputable testimony on this point. Ηe

writes thus : “ Having laid down for the soul continence
as a foundation they build the other virtues
on it. None of them would take food οr drink
before sunset, for they think that philosophy deserves
the daylight and the neceSsities οf the body
darkness ; for this reason they allot the day to the
one, and a small part οf the night to the others.
some of them neglect food for three days for the
great love of knowledge dwelling in them, and some
so delight and luxuriate in the banquet of doctrine,
so richly and ungmdgingly presided over b y wisdom,
that they abstain for twice that time, and are
accustomed scareely to taste necessary food every
six days."</p>
<p>we think that these words of Ρhilo are elear and
indisputably refer to our communion. But if after
this anyone obstinately deny it let him be converted
from his scepticism and be persuaded by
clearer indications which cannot be found among
any, save only in the worship of Christians according
to the Gospel. For Ρhilo says that women belong
aho to those under discussion and that most οf them
are aged virgins who kept their chastity from no
compulsion, like some of the priestesses among the
Greeks, but rather from voluntary opinion, from zeal
and yearning for wisdom, with which they desired
to live, and paid no attention to bdily pleasures,
longing not for mortal but for immortal children,
which only the soul that loves God is eapable of
bearing of itself. Ηe then proceeds to expound
this more elearly. “ But the interpretations of the

the Saviour by abstinellce from food and vigils and

to has given in his own writing a description οf
this, which exactly agrees with the manner which is
still observed by us and by us alone ; he relates
the vigils for the entire night of the great feast,
and the exercises during them, and the hymns which

sings regularly with cadenee, the rest listen in
silence and join in singing only the refrain of the

appropriate titles, such as “ The Things which the
Sober Μind desires and exercrates," “ On the confusion

<p>Αt this time, while Ρaul was finishing his journey
from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum,
Claudius banished the Jews from Rome, and Aquila
and Priscilla, with the other Jews, left Rome
and came into Αsia, and lived there with Ρaul the
Αpοstle, while he was strengthening the foundations
of the churches there which had reeently been laid
by him. The sacred Scripture of the Acts teaches
this also.</p>

Εmpire there was a riot and confusion in Jerusalem at
the feast οf the Ρassover so great that, merely among
those who were violently crowded together at the
ways leading οut οf the temple, thirty thousand Jews
perished by tramplinlg οn each other, and the feast
was turned into mourning for the whole nation and
into lamentation in each house. This too Josephus
relates in So many words. Claudius appointed
Agrippa, the child οf Αgrippa, as king of the Jews,
and sent out as Ρrocurator of the whole district or
samaria and Galilee, together with that called Peraea.
Ηe had administered the government for thirteen
years and eight months when he died and left Νero
his successor in the sovereignty.</p>

“ Νow a quarrel arose between the Ηigh Ρriests and
the priests and leaders of the people of Jerusalem.

Εach of them made for himself a band of the
boldest revolutionaries, of which he was the leader,
and when they met they used to abuse each other
and throw stones. There was not a single one
to rebuke this, but it was done with licence as though
in a city without government. sueh shamelessness
and audacity seized the Ηigh Priests that they
ventured to Send salves to the threshing-floors to
take the tithes owed to the prierts, and it was a
common occurrence to see destitute priests perishing
of want. Thus the violence of the factions conquered
all justice."</p>
<p>The same writer again relates that at the same
time a certain kind of bandits arose in Jerusalem,
who, as he says, murdered daily those whom they
met, even in the midst of the city. In particular at
the feasts they used to mingle with the crowd and
concealing short daggers in their clothes used to
Stab distinguished people with them ; then, when
they had fallen, the murderers themselves shared
in the indignation. In this way they evaded discovery
through the conhdence generally plaeed in
them. Jonathan the Ηigh Priest was the first to be
slain by them, but after him many were murdered
daily, and fear was worse than the disasters, for as if
in war every man was hourly expecting death.</p>

an entry into Jerusalem and overpower the Roman
garison and the people by a despotic use of the
soldiers who had joined him. But Felix, anticipating
his attaek, met him with the Roman forces, and all
the people agreed in rile defenee, so that when
battle was joined the Egyptian fled with a few
men and the greater part of those with him were
destroyed or captured."</p>

Wars, but it is worth nothing what is said about the
Egyptian there and in the Acts or the Apostles,

the Apostles to writing, finished his narrative at this
point by the statement that Ρaul spent two whole

of God without hindrance. Trdition has it that

οn the ministry of preaching, and coming a second
time to the same city suffered martyrdom under
Νerο. During this imprisonment he wrote the second
Εpistle to Timothy, indicating at the same time that
his first defence had taken place and that his martyrdom
was at hand. Νοtice his testimony on this
point : “ Αt my first defence," he says, “ no man
was with me, but all deserted me (may it not be
laid to their charge), but the Lord stood by me and
strengthened me that the preaching might be fuh
filled by me and all the Gentiles might hear, and I
was delivered from the lion's mouth." Ηe clearly
proves by this that on the first occasion, in order
that the praching which took place through him
might be fulmled, he was delivered from the lion's
mouth, apparently referring to Νero thus for his
feroeity. Ηe does not go on to add any such words
as “ he will deliver me from the lion's mouth," for
he saw in the spirit that his death was all but at hand,
wherefore after the words “ And 1 was delivered
from the lion's mouth," he goes on to say, “ The
Lord will deliver me from all evil and save me for his
heavenly kingdom," indicating his impending martrydom.
Αnd this he foretells even more clearly in the
same writing, saying, “ For ἴ’ am already offered up
and the time of my release is at hand." Νοw in the
second Epistle of those to Timothy, he states that
only Luke was with him as he wrote, and at his
Rrst defence not even he ; wherefore Luke probably
wrote the Αcts of the Apostles at that time, carrying

was not accomplished during the sojourn in
Rome which Luke describes. Ρrobably at the beginning
Νero’s disposition was genrier and it was
easier for Ρaul’s defence on behalf of his views to
be received, but as he advanced towards reckless
crime the Apostles were attacked along with the
rest.</p>

over to Rome by Festus the Jews were disappointed
of the hope in which they had laid their plot against
him and turned against James, the brother of the
Lord, to whom the throne of the bishopric in Jerisalem
had been allotted by the Apostles. The crim
which they committed was as follows. They brought
him into the midst and demanded a denial of the
faith in Christ before all the people, but When he,
contrary to the expectation of all of them, with a
loud voice and with more courage than they had
expected, confessed before all the people that our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is the son of God.

was by all men believed to be most righteous beeause
of the height which he had reached in a life of
philosophy and religion, and killed him, using anarchy
as an opportunity for power since at that moment

James's death has been Shown by the words of
Clement already quoted, narrating that he was
thrown from the battlement and beaten to death
with a club, but Hegesippus, who belongs to the
generation after the Apostles, gives the most aceurate
aeeount of him Speaking as follows in his fifth
book : “ The charge of the Church passed to James
the brother of the Lord, together with the Αpostles.
Ηe was called the ‘ Just ’ by all men from the Lord's
time to ours, since many are called James, but he
was holy from his mother's womb. Ηe drank no
wine or strong drink, nor did he eat flesh ; no razor
went upon his head ; he did not anoint himself with
oil, and he did not go to the baths. Ηe alone was
allowed to enter into the sanctuary for he did not
wear wool but linen, and he used to enter alone
into the temple and be found kneeling and praying
for forgiveness for the people, so that his knees
grew hard like a camel's because of his constant
worship of God, kneeling and asking forgiveness for
the people. so from his excessive righteousness he
was ealled the Just and Oblias, that is in Greek,
‘ Rampart of the people and righteousness,’ as the
prophets deelare concerning him. Thus Some of the
seven sectS among the people, who were desribed
before by me (in the Commentaries), inquired of him
what was the gate of Jesus,’ and he said that he was
the saviour. Owing to this some believed that Jesus
was the Chrirt. The sects mentioned above did not

<p>This account is given at length by Hegesippus,
but in agreement with Clement. Thus it seems that
James was indeed a remarkable man and ramous
among all for righteousness, so that the wise even
οf the Jews thought that this was the cause of the
siege of Jemsalem immediately after his martyrdom,
and that it happened for no other reason
than the crime which they had committed against
him.</p>
<p>of course Josephus did not shrink from giving
written testimonyp to this, as follows : “ And theSe
things happened to the Jews to avenge JameS the
Just, who was the brother of Jesus the so-called
christ, for the Jews killed him in spite of his great
righteousness." 1 The same writer also narrates his
death in the twentieth book of the Antiquities as
follows : “ Νow when Caesar heard οf the death of
Festus he sent Albinus as governor to Judaea, but
the younger Αnanus, who, as we said, had received
the Ηigh Priesthood, was bold in temperament
and remarkably daring. Ηe followed the Seet of
the sadducees, who are cruel in their judgements
beyond all the Jews, as we have already explained.
nus his eharacter led Αnanus to think that he had
a suitable opportunity through the faet that Festus
was dead and Albinus still on his way. Ηe sum-
moned a council of judges, brought before it the
brother of Jesus, the so-ealled Christ, whose name
was James, and some otherS, on the accusation of
breaking the law and delivered them to be stoned.

the citizens and strict observers of the law were

but the holy Apostles and disciples of our Saviour
were seattered throughout the whole world. Thomas,
as tradition relates, obtained by lot Parthia, Andrew
Scythia, John Asia (and he stayed there and died
in Ephesus), but Ρeter Seems to have preached to
the Jews of the Dispersion in Pontus and Galatia
and Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia, and at the end
he came to Rome and was crueffied head downwards,
for so he had demanded to suffer. What need
be said of Ρaul, who fulffiled the gospel of Christ from
Jerusalem to Illyria and afterward was martyred in
Rome under Νerο ? This is stated exactly by Οrigen
in the third volume of his commentary on Genesis.</p>
<p>II. Αfter the martyrdom of Paul and Ρeter, Linus
was the first appointed to the bishopric of the church
of Rome. Ρaul mentions him when writing from
Rome to Timothy in the salutation at the end of the

this in their οwn writings as unquestioned, but the
so-called second Epistle we have not received as
canonical, but nevertheless it has appeared useful to
many, and has been studied with other seriptures.
On the other hand, of the Αcts bearing his name,
and the Gospel named according to him and Preaching
called his and the so-called Revelation, we have
no knowledge at all in Catholic tradition, for no
orthodox1 writer of the andent time or of our
own has used their testimonies. Αs the narrative

any of the doubtful books, and what they said about
the canonical and accepted scriptures and what
about those which are not such. Νow the above are
the books bearing the name of Ρeter, of which I
recognize only οne as genuine and admitted by the
presbyters of old. Αnd the fourteen letters of Ρaul
are obvious and plain, yet it is not right to ignore
that some dispute the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying
that it was rejected by the church of Rome as not
being by Ρaul, and I will expound at the proper time
what was sriald about it by our predecessors. Νor
have I received his so-called Acts among undisputed
books. But since the same Apostle in the salutations

Hermas, whose, they say, is the Book of the shepherd,

<p>IV. Νοw it would be clear from Paul's own words
and from the narrative of Luke in the Acts that Ρaul,
in his preaching to the Gentiles, laid the foundations
of the churches from Jerusalem round about unto
Illyricum. Αnd from the Epistle which we have
spoken of as indisputably Peter's, in which he writes
to those of the Hebrews in the Dispersion of Pontus
and Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, it
would be clear from his own words in how many
provinces he delivered the word οf the Νew Testament
by preaching the Gospel of Christ to those of
the eireumcision. But it is not easy to say how
many οf these and which of them were genuinely
zealous and proved their ability to be the pastors of
the churches founded by the Apostles, except by
making a list of those mentioned by raul. For
there were many thousands of his fellow-workers and,
as he called them himself, fellow - soldiers, of whom the
most were granted by him memorial past forgetting,
for he recounts his testimony to them unceasingly in
his own letters, and, moreover, Luke also in the Acts
gives a list of those known to him and mentions them
by name. Thus Timothy is related to have been the
first appointed bishop of the diocese of Ephesus, as

was Titus of the ehurehes in Crete. Luke, who was
by raee an Antiochian and a physician by profession,
was long a companion of Ρaul, and had careful conversation
with the other Apostles, and in two
books left us examples of the medicine for souls
which he had gained from them—the Gospel, which
he testifies that he had planned according to the
tradition reeeived by him by those who were from
the beginning eyewitnesses and ministers of the
word, all of whom he says,1 moreover, he had followed
from the beginning, and the Acts of the Apostles
which he composed no longer on the evidence of
hearing but of his own eyes. Αnd they say that
Paul was actually accustomed to quote from Luke's
Gospel since when writing of some Gospel as his own
he used to say, “ According to my ” Of the
other followers of Ρaul there is evidence that
Crescens was sent by him to Gaul, and Linus, who is
mentioned in the seeond Epistle to Timothy as
present with him in Rome has already been deelared
to have been the first after Ρeter to be appointed to
the bishopric of the Chureh in Rome. Of Clement
too, who was himself made the third bishop of the
chureh of Rome, it is testified by Paul that he worked
and strove in company with him. In addition to
these Dionysius, one of the ancients, the pastor Of
the diocese of the Corinthians, relates that the first
bishop of the Chureh at Athens was that member of
the Areopagus, the Οther Dionysius, whose original
eonversion after Ρaul’s speech to the Athenians in
the Areopagus Luke deseribed in the Acts. Now

year and six months, and then Vespasian, who had distinguished
himself in the operations against the Jews,
was proclaimed Imperator by the army there and
appointed Emperor in Judaea itself. Ηe at once
set off for Rome and entrusted the war against the
Jews to his son Titus. Now after the ascension of
our Saviour in addition to their crime against him
the Jews at onee contrived numberless plots against
his disciples. Stephen was first stoned to death by
them and next after him James, the son of Zebedee
and brother of John, was beheaded.3 In addition to
all, James, who was the first after the ascension οf
our Saviour to be appointed to the throne of the
bishopric in Jerusalem, paried away in the manner
deseribed above and the other Apostles were driven
from the land of Judaea by thousands of deadly
Ρlots. They went on their way to all the heathen
teaching their mesage in the power of Christ for

people οf the church in Jerusalem were commanded
by an oracle given by revelation before the war to
those in the city who were worthy of it to depart and
dwell in one οf the cities of Perea which they called
Ρella. To it those who believed on Christ migrated
from Jerusalem, that when holy men had altogether
deserted the royal eapital of the Jews and the Whole
land of Judaea, the judgement of God might at last
overtake them for all their crimes against the Christ
and his Apostles, and all that generation οf the wicked
be utterly blotted out from among men. Those who
wish can retrace accurately from the history written
by Josephus how many evils at that time overwhelmed
the whole nation in every place and especially
how the inhabitants οf Judaea were driven to
the last point of suffering, how many thousands οf
youths, women, and children perished by the sword,
by famine, and by countless other forms of death ;

cities were besieged, and Rnally how terrors and

Jerusalem as if to a mighty capital; they can study

abomination of deSolation spoken of by the prophets
was set up in the very temple of God, for all its

those who would soon die of need. Μany secretly
exchanged their property for a single measure or
wheat, if they were richer, of barley, if they were
poorer. Then, shutting themselves up in the inmost
recesses of their houSes, some, in the extremity of
their want, would eat the grain unprepared, others
would cook it as necessity and fear dietated. No
table was set anyWhere, but snatching it from the
fire they tore in pieces the still uncooked food.
Their living was pitiable, and their appearance worthy
of tears ; the strong plundered and the weak wailed.
Famine truly surpasses all sufferings, but it destroys
nothing so much as shame 1 ; for what is at other
times worthy of respect is despised in famine ; women
took the food from the very mouths of their husbands,
children from their fathers, and, most piteous of all,
mothers from their children, and while their deareSt
were wasting away before them there WaS no scruple
in taking away the last drop of life. Yet they did
not escape detection When they thus ate, but everywhere
the rioters arose to rob them even of this;
for whenever they Saw a house Shut up it was a sign
that those within had obtained food and at onee they
tore down the doors, ruShed in, and seized the
morSelS, almost squeering them out of their throats.
Old men were beaten for withholding food, and
Women were dragged by the hair for concealing it
in their hands. There Was no pity for grey-headed
age or for little children, but they picked up babies
clinging to crusts and dashed them on the floor.

To those who had anticipated their entry, and had
gulped down their expected prey, they were the
more cruel, as though they had been injured by
them. For the ffiscovery of food they sought for
terrible methods of torture, sewing up their victims
and inmpaling them on sharp stakes. Men suffered
things terrible even to hear to secure the confession
of a single loaf, and to disclose a single pint of hidden
barley. But the torturers suKered no hunger (and
indeed their cruelty would have been less had it been
from neeessity) but there was method in their madness
and they prorided sustenanee for themselves
for days to come. When some crept out by night
as far as the Roman lines to gather wild herbs and
grass, they intercepted them when they thought
that they had at last escaped the enemy, plundered
them of what they were carrying, and for all their
many entreaties and invocations of the awful name
οf God to give them some share οf what they had
brought at their οwn risk, they gave them nothing
whatever, and he Who Was robbed was lueky not to

Αfter some οther details he continues: “Νow When
all hope of safety was cut off from the Jews by the
closing of the exits from the city and famine deepening
from house to house and family to family was
eating up the people, the rooms were filled with
dead women and children and the alley—ways
the corpses of old men. Boys and young men,
wandering 1 like ghosts through the market—place,
were seimd by death and lay each where the blow
had stricken him. The sick had no strength to bury
sufferers from famine, not of ghosb (and the text seems
corrupt). Or it may be “ swllen yet ghost—like ghost—like ’’

perished in the city from the famine the number

For in each house if there appeared the

dearest friends wrestled together for it, snatching
the miserable sustenance of life. Νor were even the
dying believed to be destitute, but while they were
still breathing the robbers searched them, lest any

others, gaping from lack of food, stumbled and
hurried along like mad dogs, beating at the doors

Necessity brought all things to men's

Were I to compromise the account of her sufferings.
There was a woman among those who lived beyond
Jordan named Mary whose father was Eliezer of the
village Bathezor (which means “ House of ”).
She was famous for her family and Wealth, and
having fled with the rest of the population to Jerusalem
was eaught in the Siege. The tyrants seized
all her other possessions which she had brought from
Peraea and carried into the city, and the guards
rushed in daily and seized the iemnants of her
property and any food which they perceived. Fierce
indignation seized the woman and by her frequent
abuseS and curses she tried to irritate the robbers
against herSelf. But when no one killed her either
in anger or pity and she wearied of finding food for
others, and indeed it was now impossible to do so
anywhere, famine entered into her heart and marrow,
and rage burnt more fiercely than famine. Anger
and neceSsity were her councillors: she turned
against nature and seized her child, a boy whom She
was suckling. ‘Miserable infant,’ she said, ‘amid
war, famine, and rebellion for what 1 am I keeping
you ? Slavery among the Romans faces us if
they give us our liveS ; famine is overtaking slavery;
the rebelS are worse than both. Come, be food for
me, an avenging fury to the rebels, and the one
story still lacking to the sufferings of the Jews to
be told to the world.’ With these words she
her son, and then cooked him, ate half, and covered

of the rebels and bandits were pointed out by one

The tallest of the youths, and those distinguished for
physical beauty, were kept for a triumph, and of the
remaining population those above seventeen years
old Were sent as prisoners to hard labour in Egypt,
but more were distributed throughout the provinces
to be destroyed in the theatres by the sword and by
wild beasts. Those below seventeen years old were
sold into slavery and these alone were 90.000.</p>
<p>These things happened in this Way in the second
year of the reign of Vespasian in accordance with
the prophetic utterances of Our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, who foreseeing them by divine power as

mourned according to the writing of the saered
evangelist, who appends his actual words. For once
he said to Jerusalem herself, “ If thou hadst known,
even thou, in this day the thing which belong to
thy peaee : but now they are hid from thine eyes,
for the days will come upon thee When thine enemy
Shall cart a trench around thee and compass thee

of our Saviour with the other narratives of the
historian concerning the whole war, how can he avoid
surprise and a confession οf the truly divine and
supematurally wonderful character both of the foreknowledge
knowledge and of the foretelling οf our Saviour?</p>
<p>There is no necessity to add to the narratives of
what happened to the whole nation after the passion
of the Saviour and those words in which the multitude
of the Jews begged off from death the robber and
murderer and besought that the author of Life
should be taken from them ; but it would be right
to add a possible connnnation οf the kindliness οf
beneficent Providence. For forty whole years it
suspended their dertruction, after their crime against
the Christ, and during all of them many ofthe apostles
and disciples, and James himself, who is called the
Lord's brother, the first bishop of the city, still survived
in this world. By their dwelling in Jerusalem,
they afforded, as it were, a strong proteetion to the
place; for the govemment of God had still patience,
if haply they might at last by repenting of their
deeds, be able to obtain pardon and salvation; and
in addition to such great long—suffering it
wonderful tokens from God οf what would happen
to them if they did not repent. These things have
been thought worthy of mention by the historian
already quoted, and there is nothing better than to
append them for the readers of this work.</p>

sixth book of the Jervish War. “ Now at that time
impostors and lying prophets perverted the miserable
people, but they gaVe neither attention nor
credence to the clear marvels which foretold approaching
desolation, but as though they had been thunderstruck
and had neither eyes nor soul, they neglected
the declarations of God. Αt One time a star stood
over the city like a sword, and a comet which lasted
for a year. Αt another tlme, before the insurrection,
and the disturbance which led to the war, when the
people were assembled for the Feast of Unleavened
Bread, on the eighth of April, at the ninth hour of
the night, a light shone on the alter and on the
temple so brightly that it seemed to be full day, and
this lasted for half an hour. TO the inexperienced
this seemed a good sign, but was at once interpreted
by the seribes before the events which actually
followed. Αnd at thc same feast a cow, which had
been led by the —priest for the sacrifice, gave
birth to a lamb in the middle of the tempIe, And
the eastern gate of the inner building, which was of
bronze and very massive and was closed at evening
time with difficulty by twenty men, and rested on
beams bound with iron and had bars sunk deep, was
seen at night at the sixth hour to have opened of
itself. Αnd after the feast, not many days later, on
the twenty—first of May, a demonic phantom
of increffible size, and what will be related would
have seemed a fairy-tale had it not been told by

appeared in the air over the whole country chariots
and armed troops coursing through the clouds and
surrounding the cities. Αnd at the feast called
Pentecost the priests passed into the temple at night,

a sudden cry, ‘ We go hence’ But what was
terrible a man of the people named Jesus, the son
οf Ananias, a countryman, four years before the war,
when the city was in complete peaee and prosperity,
came to the feast when it was the custom for all to
make booths for God, and began suddenly to cry οut

from the west, a voice from the four winds, a voice
against Jerusalem and the temple, a voice against
bridegrooms and brides, a voice against all the
people.’ With this cry night and day he

cry as before. But the rulers thought that the man's

Josephus. “ Αnd when Albinus, for he was governor, asked
him who he was and whence he came and why he said these
things, he made no answer but did not cease reising his
lamentation against the city until Albinus considered him
mad and let him go. Until the time οf the war he neither
approached any of the citizens nor was he seen talking, but
daily, as though reciting a prayer, he wailed ‘Woe, woe to
’ He never cursed those who struck him daily,
nor did he bless those who gave him food, but all received
the same melancholy wail as an answer. He howled with
especial vigour on feast days, and this he kept up for seven
year and five months, nor did his voice fail or grow weary
until at the siege he rested, seeing his lamentations fulfilled.
For he went round on the wall with the piercing cry, ‘Woe,
woe to the people, to the city, and to the temple,’ and as
last he ‘ Woe, woe to me also,´ a stone flew
from a catapult and hit him; he died at once, and gave up
his soul still uttering those lamentations.”</note>

Moses and contain the Law and the tradition of
human history until his deatll. This period covers
almost three thousand years. From the death of
Moses to Artaxerxes who succeeded Xerxes, king
of the Persians, the prophets after Moses wrote the
aecount of the events contemporary with them in
thirteen books. 1 The remaining four books contain
hymns to God and precepts for the life of men.
From the time of Artaxerxes to our own the details
have been written, 2 but are not considered worthy
οf equal credence with the rest because there has
not been an aceurate succession of prophetS. Αnd
facts show plainly how we approach our own literature,
for though so long a time has elapsed no one
has dared to make additions, omissions, or changes,
but it is innate in Jews from their very birth to
regard them as the decreeS of God, to abide in them
and, if it need be, to die for them ” This
quotation from the author may be usefully appended.</p>
<p>Another work which is not without merit was
produced by him on The Supremacy of Reason, which
some entitled Maccabees 3 because it contains the
conflicts of those Hebrews mentioned in the so-called
books of the Maccabees, who strove valiantly for the
worship of God. Αt the end of the twentieth book
οf the Antiquities the same writer announces that he
had planned to compose four books on the aneestral
belief of the Jews concerning God and his nature and

treatises that he had produced other works. Moreover,
it is right to mention the words which he appends
to the end οf the Antiquities to confirm our quotation
οf the passages taken from him. Accusing of false
statements Justus of Tiberias, who had undertaken
to write a similar account of the same period, and
bringing many οther charges against him, he continues
as follows : “ I had no such fear as you with
regard to my own writing, but I gave the books to
the Emperors themselves while the events were still
almost before their eyes. For I was conscious of
having kept the tradition of the truth and I did not
fail in my expectation of obtaining their testimony
to that effect. I also gave the narrative to many
others, of whom some had actually taken part in the
war, such as King Agrippa and some of his relations.
For the Emperor Titus Was pleased that from these
book alone should information be given the public
as to the events, and, writing with his own hand, he
ordered the books to be published, and King Agrippa
wrote sixty-two letters testifying that they were
handing on the ” of these letters he appends

as to whom they οught to adjudge worthy to succeed

son οf Clopas, whom the scripture οf the Gospel also
mentions, was worthy of the throne of the diocese
there. He was, so it is said, a cousin οf the Saviour,
for Hegesippus relates that Clopas was the brother
of Joseph, (XII.) and in addition that Vespasian,
after the capture of Jerusalem, ordered a seareh to
be made for all who were of the family of David,
that there might be left among the Jews no one
of the royal family and, for this reason, a very great
persecution was again infficted οn the Jews.</p>

his great cruelty and had put to death without any
reasonable trial no small number of men distinguished
at Rome by family and career, and had punished without
a cause myriads of other notable men by banishment
and confiscation of their property, he finally
showed himself the successor of Nero's campaign of
hostility to God. Ηe was the second to promote
persecution against uS, though his father, Vespasian,

the days described that even writers foreign to
our belief did not hesitate to commit to their narratives
the persecutions and the martyrdoms in it,
and they even indicated the time accurately, relating
that in the fifeenth year 1 of Domitian, Flavia

grandsons of Judas (who is said to have been the
brother, according to the flesh, of the Saviour) saying
that they were of the family of David and related to
the Christ himself. Hegesippus this exactly
as follows. XX. “ Now there still survived of the
family of the Lord grandsons of Judas, who was
said to have been his brother according to the flesh,

David. These tlle officer 2 brought to Domitian

their hands, adducing as testimony of their labour
the hardness of their bodies, and the tough skin
which had been embossed on their hands from
their incessant work. They were asked concerning
the Christ and his kingdom, its nature, origin,
and time of appearance, and explained that it
was neither of the world nor earthly, but heavenly
and angelic, and it would be at the end of the world,
when he would come in glory to judge the living and
the dead and to reward every man according to his
deeds. At this Domitian did not condemn them at
all, but despised them as simple folk, released them,
and decreed an end to the persecution against the
church. But when they were released they were the
leaders of the churches, both for their testimony
and for their relation to the Lord, and remained
alive in the peace which ensued until Trajan.
Hegesippus tells this ; moreover, Tertullian also has
made similar mention of Domitian. “ Domitian
also once tried to do the same as he, for he was a
Nero in cruelty, but, Ι helieve, inasmuch as he
had some sense, he stopped at once and recalled

<p>Αfter Domitian had reigned fifteen years, Nerva
succeeded. 1 The sentences οf Domitian were annulled,
and the Roman Senate decreed the return
οf those who had been unjustly banished and the
restoration of their property. Those who committed
the story οf those times to writing relate it. Αt
that time, too, the story of the ancient Christians
relates that the Apostle John, after his banishment
to the island, took up his abode at Ephesus.</p>
<p>XXI. After Νerva had reigned a little more than
a year he was suceeeded by Trajan,2 in whose first
year Abilius, after leading the diocese οf Alexandria
for thirteen years, was sueceeded by Cerdo ; he
was the third in charge οf that see after the first,
Annianus. Αt this time Clement was still governing
the Romans and he, also, occupied the third Ρlace
in the list οf bishops in Rome after Ρaul and Ρeter ;
Linus was the first and after him Anencletus.
XXII. Moreover, at the time mentioned, Ignatius
was famous as the second bishop at Antioch where
Evodius had been the first. Likewise at this time,
Simeon was second after the brother οf our Saviour
to hold the ministry of the church in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>XXIII. Αt this time that very disciple whom Jesus
loved, John, at οnce Apostle and Evangelist, still
remained alive in Asia and administered the churches
there, for after the death of Domitian, he had returned
from his banishment οn the island. Αnd that
he remained alive until this time may fully be confirmed
by two witnesses, and these ought to be
trustworthy for they represent the orthodoxy of the

Ρlace in the second οf his books Against the Hereises,
as follows : “ Αnd all the presbyters who had been
associated in Asia with John, the disciple of the
Lord, bear witness to his tradition, for he remained
with them until the timesk of ” Αnd in the
third book οf the same work he makes the same
statement as follows : “ Νοw the church at Εphesus
was founded by Ρaul, but Johu stayed there until
the times οf Trajan, and it is a true witness of the
tradition οf the Apostles.”</p>
<p>Clement indicates the same time, and in the
treatise to which he gave the title Who is the rich
man that is saved, adds a narrative most acceptable
to those who enjoy hearing what is fine and edifying.
Take and read here what he wrote. “ Listen to a
story which is not a story but a true tradition οf
John the Apostle Ρreserved in memory. For after
the death of the tyrant he passed from the island of
Ρatmos to Εphesus, and used also to go, when he
was asked, to the neighbouring districts of the
heathen,1 in some places to appoint bishops, in others
to reconcile whole churches, and in others to ordain
some οne of those pointed out by the spirit. Ηe
came to one οf the cities which were near by (and
some tell cven its name),2 and gave rest in general

John then returned to Ephesus and the presbyter1
took to his house the young man entrusted to him,
brought him up, looked after him, and finally
baptized him. Αfter this he relaxed his great care
and watchfulness, because he had set upon him
the seal of the Lord as the perfect safeguard.
But some idle and dissolute youths, familiar with
evil, corrupted him in his presature freedom. First
they led him on by expensive feasts, then they
started out at night for robbery and took him with
them, then they urged him to greater crimes. Ηe
gradually became accustomed to this, and like an
unbroken and powerful horse starting from the
straight way and tearing at the bit, rushed all the

Finally he renounced salvation from God; and now he
planned nothing small, but, having perpetrated
some great crime, since he was ruised once for all,
accepted the same lot as the others. Ηe collected
them and formed a band of brigands and was himself
a born chief, excelling in violence, in murder, and
in cruelty. Time went on and some necessity arose
to summon John. When he had arranged the rest
of his mission John said, ‘Come now, bishop, pay me
back the deposit which Christ and I left with you,

Those inspired and venerable ancients, I mean Christ's
Apostles, had completely purified their life and
adorned their souls with every virtue, yet were but
simple men in speech. Though they were indeed
bold in the divine and wonder-working power given
them by the saviour, they had neither the knowledge
or the desire to represent the teachings of the
Master in persuasive or artiStic language, but they
used only the proof of the spirit of God which worked

which was consummated through them. Thus they

to all the world and cared but little for attention
to their style. Αnd this they did inasmuch as they
were serving a greater, superhuman ministry. Thus
Ρaul, the most powerful of all in the preparation
of argument and the Strongest thinker, committed
to writing no more than short epistles, though he had
ten thousand ineffable thngs to say, seeing that he
had touched the vision of the third heaven, had been
caught up to the divine paradise itself, and was there
granted the hearing ineffable words. Νor were the
other pupils of our Saviour without experience of the
same things, —the twelve Apostles and the seventy
disciples and ten thousand others in addition to them.
Yet nevertheless of all those who had been with the
Lord only Matthewand John have left theirrecollections,
and tradition says that they took to writing perforce.
Matthew had first preached to Hebrews, and
when he was on the point of going to others he transmitted
in writing in his native language the Gospel
according to himself, and thus supplied by writhing the
Ιack of his own presence to those from whom he was
sent, and Mark and Luke had already published the
Gospels according to them, but John, it is said, used
all the time a message which was not written down,
and at last took to writing for the following cause.
The three gospels which had been written down before
were distributed to all including himself ; it is said
that he welcomed them and testified to their truth
but said that there was only lacking to the narrative
the account of what waS done by Christ at first and
at the beginning of the preaehing. The story is

surely true. It is at least possible to see that the
three evanglists related only what the Saviour did
during one year after John the Baptist had been put
in prison and that they stated this at the beginning
or their nauative. Αt any rate, after the forty
’ fast, and the temptation which followed
Matthew fixes the time described in his own writing
by saying that “ hearing that John had been
betrayed, he retreated ’’ from Judaea “ into ”
Similarly Mark says, “ and after John was betrayed
Jesus came into ” Αnd Luke, too, makes a
similar observation before beginning the acts οf
Jcsus saying that Ηerod added to the evil deeds
which he had done by “ shutting up John in ”
ney say accordingly that for this reason the apostle
John was asked to relate in his own gospel the period
Ρassed over in silence by the former evangelists and
the things done during it by the Saviour (that is to
say, the events before the imprisonment of the
Baptist), and that he indicated this at one time by
saying, “ this beginning οf miracles did ” at
another by mentioning the Baptists in the the of
the acts of Jesus as at that time still baptizing at
Aenon near salem, and that he makes this plain by
saying, “ for John was not yet cast into prison. ”
Thus John in the course of his gospel relates what
Christ did before the Baptist had been thrown into
prison, but the other three evangelists narrate the
events after the imprisonment of the Baptist. If

this be understood the gospels no longer appear to
disagree, becauswe that according to John contains
the first of the acts οf Christ and the others the
narrative of what he did at the end of the poriod,
and it will seem probable that John passed over
the genealogy οf our Saviour according to the flesh,
because it had been already written out by Matthew
and Luke, and began with the description of his
divinity since this had been reserved for him by the
Divine Spirit as for one greater than they.</p>
<p>The above must suffice us concerning the writing
of the Gospel according to John, and the cause for
that according to Μark has been explained above.
Luke himself at the beginning of his treatise prefixed
an account οf the cause for which he had made his
compilation, explaining that while many others had
somewhat rashly attempted to make a narrative of the
things οf which he had himself full knowledge, 1 he felt
obliged to release us from the doubtful propositions of
the others and related in his own gospel the accurate
account of the things οf which he had shimself firmly
learnt the truth from his profitable intercourse and
life with Ρaul and his conversation with the other
apostles. This must suffice us for the present, but
at the proper time we will endeavour to explain by
citation from the ancients what has been said on
the point by others.</p>

the first of his epistles has been accepted without
controversy by ancients and moderns alike but the
οther two are disputed, and as to the Revelation there

have been many advocates of either opinion up to
the present. This, too, shall be similarly illustrated
by quotations from the ancients at the proper time.</p>
<p>XXV. Αt this point it seems reasonable to summarize
the writings of the Νew Testament which
have been quoted. Ιn the first place should be
put the holy tetrad of the Gospels. To them follows
the writing οf the Αcts of the Apostles. Αfter this
should be reckoned the Epsitles of Ρaul. Following
them the Epistle of John called the first, and in the
same way should be recognized the Epistle of Ρeter.
In addition to these should be put, if it Seem desirable,
the Revelation of John, the arguments concerning
which we will expound at the proper time.
These belong to the Recognized Books. Of the
Disputed Books which are nevertheless known to
most are the Epistle called of James, that of Jude,
the second Epistle of Ρeter, and the so-called second
and third Εpistles of John which may be the work
οf the evangelist or of some other with the same
name. Among the books which are not genuine
must be reckoned the Acts of Ρaul, the work entitled
the Shepherd, the Apocalypse or Ρeter, and in
addition to them the letter called of Barnabas and the
so-called Teachings of the Apostles. Αnd in addition,
as I said, the Revelation of John, if this view prevaial.
For, as I said, some reject it, but others count it
among the Recognized Books. Some have also
counted the Gospel according to the Hebrews in
which those of the Hebrews who have aceepted Christ
take a special pleasure. These would all belong to
the disputed books, but we have nevertheleSs been
obliged to make a list of them, distinguishing between
those writings which, according to the tradition of

put forward by heretics under the name of the

and Thomas, and Matthias, and some others besides,
or Acts such as those of Andrew and John and the

belonged to the succession of the orthodox ever
thought it right to refer in his writings. Moreover
the type of phraseology differs from apostolic
style, and the opinion and tendeney of their

which he delivered, for those who were vouchsafed
it would obtain a share of eternal immortality in
this life itself, no longer mortal but remaining here,
destined to everlasting and ageless immortality.
This point can also be easily studied from the writings
of Irenaeus. Justin, too, in the same way after
mentioning Simon continues his account of him by
saying, “ We also know that a certian Menander,
who abo was a samaritan from the village of Caparat
taea, became a disciple of Simon and being similarly
srimulated by the demons appeared in Antioch and
deceived many by magical arts. He persuaded
those who followed him that they would not die,
and there are still some of his followers who believe
this.”</p>
<p>It was assuredly at the instigation of the devil
that the name οf Christian was adopted by such
sorcerers to calumniate by magic the great mystery
of religion and through them to destroy the teaching
of the Chureh on the immortality οf the soul and the
resurrection of the dead. Those who termed these
Saviours fell from the true hope. XXVII. But others
the wiched demon, when he could not aliienate them
from God's plan in Christ, made his own, when he
found them by a different snare. The first Christians
gave these the suitablename of Ebionites because they
had poor and mean opinions concerning Christ. They
held him to be a plain and ordinary man who had
achieved righteousness merely by the progress of his
characcter and had been born naturally from Mary and
her busband. They insisted on the complete observation
of the Law, and did not think that they would be
saved by faith in Christ alone and by a life in accordance
with it. But there were others besides these

folly of the first mentioned, and did not deny that
the Lord was born of a Virgin and the Ηoly Spirit,
but nevertheless agreed with them in not confessing
his pre-existence as God, being the Logos and
Wisdom. Thus they shared in the impiety of the
former class, especially in that they were equally
zealous to insist on the literal observance of the Law.
They thought that the letters ofthe Apostle 1 ought to
be wholly rejecgted and called him an apostate from
the Law. They used only the Gospel called according
to the Hebrews and made little account of the
rest. Like the former they used to observe the
sabbath and the rest of the Jewish ceremonial, but
on Sundays celebrated rites like ours in commemoration
of the Saviour's resurrection. wherefore from
these practices they have obtained their name, for
the name οf Ebionites indicates the poverty of their
intelligence, for this name meanS “ poor ’’ in Hebrew.2</p>

revelations attributed to the writing of a great
apostle, lyingly introduees portents to us as though
shown him by angels, and says that after the resurrection

Dionysius, too, who held the bishopric of the diocese
of Alexandria in οur time, in the second book of his
Promises makes some remarks about the Apocalypse
οf John as though from ancient οn and refers
to the same Cerintus in these words, “ Cerintus
too, who founded the Cerinthian heresy named after
him, wished to attaeh a name worthy of credit to
his οwn invention, for the doctrine of his teaching
was this, that the kingdom οf Christ would be οn
earth, and being fond of his body and very camal
he dreamt of a future according to his own desires,
given up the the indulgence of the flesh, that is,
eating and drinking and marrying, and to those
things which seem a euphemism for these things,
feasts and sacrifices and the slaughter of victums.”</p>
<p>Dionysius said this and Irenaeus in his first book
Agianst Heresies quoted some οf his more abominable
errors, and in the third book has committed to writing
a narrative, which deserves not to be forgotten,
stating how aecorffing to the traffidltion of Polycarp,
the apostle John once went into a bath-house to
wash, but when he knew that Cerinthus was within
leapt out of the place and Red from the door, for he
did not endure to be even under the same roof with
him, and enjoined οn those who were with him to do
the same, saying, “ Let us flee, lest the bath-house

<p>XXIX. Αt this time, too, there existed for a short
time the heresy of the Nicolaïtans of which the
of John also makes mention. These elaimed
Nicolas, one of the deacons in the company of Stephen
who were appointed by the Apostles for the serviee
of the poor. Clement or Αlexandria in the third book
of the Stromata gives the following account of him.
“ Ηe had, they say, a beautiful wife ; but after the
ascension of the saviour he was accused of jealousy
by the apostles, and brought her forward and
commanded her to be mated to anyone who wished.
They say that this aetion was in consequenee of the
injunction ‘ it is necessary to abuse the ’ and
that by following up what had been done and said
with simplicity and without perversion those who
follow his heresy lead a life of unrestrained license.
But Ι have learned that Nicolas had nothing to do
with any other woman beside her whom he married,
and that of his children the daughters reaehed old
age as virgins, and that the son remained uncorrupted.
Since this is the case it is clear that
the exposure of the wife of whom he was jealous
in the midst of the disciples was the abandonment of
passion, and that teaching the abuse of the flesh
was continence from the pleasures which he had
sought. For I think that according to the command
οf the Saviour he did not whish to serve two masters
— pleasure and the Lord. They also say that this
was the teaching of Matthias, to slight the flesh and
abuse it, yielding nothing to it for pleasure, but to
make the soul grow through faith and knowledge.”</p>

John has also been already 1 mentioned, and the place
of his body is shown by a letter of Polycrates (he was
bishop of the diocese of Ephesus) which he wrote to
Vietor, bishop of Rome. In this he mentions both
John, Philip the apostle, 2 and Philip's daughters as
follows: “ For great luminaries sleep in Asia, and
they will rise again at the last day of the advent
of the Lord, when he shall come with glory from
heaven and call back all the saints, such as was
Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who sleeps at
Hierapolis with his two daughters who grew old as
virgins and his third daughter 3 who lived in the
ΗoΙy Spirit and rests in Ephesus. Αnd there is also
John, who leaned on the Lord's breast, who was a
priest wearing the mitre,4 and martyr and
and he sleeps at ” So far concerning their
deaths. Αnd in the dialogue of Gaius, which we
mentioned a little earlier, Proclus, with whom he
was disputing, speaks thus about the death of
Philip and his daughters and agrees with what has
been stated. “ Αfter him the four daughters of
Philip who were prophetesses were at Hierapolis
in Αsia. Their grave is there and so is their ”
so he says. Αnd Luke in the Acts of the Apostles
mentions the daughters of Philip who were then
living with their father at Caesarea in Judaea and

<p>We have now described the facts which have come
to our knowledge concerning the Apostles and their
times, the sacred writings which they have left us,
those books which are disputed yet nevertheless are
used openly by many in most churches, and those
which are altogether fictitious and foreign to our
historic orthodoxy. Let us now continue the
narrative.</p>
<p>XXXII. Αfter Νero and Domitian tradition says
that under the Emperor whose times we are now describing
persecution was raised against us sporadically,
in some cities, from pupular risings. We have
learnt that in it Symeon, the son οf Clopas, whom
we showed to have been the second hishop of the
church at Jerusalem, ended his life in martyrdom.
The witness for this is that same Hegesippus, of
whom we have already quoted several passages.
Αfter speaking of certain hereties he goes on to
explain how Symeon was at this time accused by
them and for many days was tortured in various
manners for being a Christain, to the great astonishment
of the judge and those with him, until he
suffered an end like that of the Lord. But there is
nothing better than to listen to the historian who
tells these facts as follows. “ some οf these (that

Ηe writes thus: “ They came therefore and presided
over every chureh as witnesses belonging to the
Lord's family, and when there was complete peace
in every cherch they survived until the reign of
the Emperor Trajan, until the time when the son
of the Lord's uncle, 2 the aforesaid Simon the son of
Clopas, was similarly accused by the sects on the

of these times, adds that until then the church
remained a pure and uncorrupted virgin, for those
who attempted to corrupt the healthful rule of the
Saviour's preaching, if they existed at all, lurked in
obscure darlness. But when the sacred band of
the Apostles and the generation of those to whom
it had been vouchsafed to hear with their own ears
the divine wisdom had reached the several ends of
their lives, then the federation of godless error
took its beginning through the deceit of false teachers
who, seeing that none of the Apostles still remained,
barefacedly tried against the preaching of the truth
the counter-proclamation οf “ knowledge falsely
so-called.”</p>
<p>XXXIII. The persecution which at that time was
extended against us in many places was so great that
Plinius secundus, one of the most distinguished
governors, was disturbed at the number of the martyrs,
and reported to the Emperor the number of those being
put to death for the faith, and in the same document
mentioned that he understood them to do nothing
wicked or illegal except that they rose at dawn to
sing to Christ as though a God, and that they themselves
forbade adultery, murder and similar terrible
crimes, and that they did eVerything in obedienee
to the law. In answer to this Trajan issued a decree
to the effect that the tribe of Christians should not
be sought for but punished when it was met with.
By this means the imminent threat of persecution
was extinguished to some extent, but none the less
opportunities remained to those who wished to harm

loeal authorities contrived plots against us, so that
with no pen persecution partial attacks broke out
in various provinces and many of the faithful endured
martyrdom in various ways. The narrative has been
taken from the Latin apology of Tertullian mentioned
above of which the translation is as follows: “ Υet
we found that this attempt against us was also
prevented, for the governor of the province, Pliny
secundus, after eondemning certain Christians and
depriving them of their rank, was troubled at their
number and, not knowing what to do in the future,
eommunieated with the Emperor Trajan. saying that
beyond their unwillingness to offer sacrifice to idols,
he had found nothing wicked in them. Ηe also
mentioned this that the Christians arose at dawn
and sang a hymn to Christ as a God, and in order
to preserve their teaching 1 forbade murder, adultery,
covetousness, robbery, and suchlike. To this Trajan
sent a rescript that the tribe of Christians should
not be sought out but punished if met ” such

Jerusalem.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Αt this time there flourished in Asia Polycarp,
the companion of the Apostles, who had been
appointed to the bishopric of the church in Smyrna
by The eyewitnesses and ministers of the Lord.
Distinguished men at the same time were Papias,
who was himself bishop of the diocese of Hierapolis,
and Ignatius, still a name of note to most men, the
second after Ρeter to succeed to the bishopric of
Antioch. The story goes that he was sent from Syria
to Rome to be eaten by beasts in testimony to Christ.
Ηe was taken through Asia under most careful guard,
and strengthened by his speech and exhortation
the diocese of eaeh city in which he stayed. Ηe
particularly warned them to be on their guard
against the heresies which then for the first time
were beginning to obtain, and exhorted them to
hold fast to the tradition of the Apostles, to which
he thought necessary, for safety's sake, to give the
form of written testimony. Thus while he was in
Smyrna where Polycarp was, he wrote one letter
to the church at Ephesus, mentioning their pastor
Onesimus, and another to the church at Mangnessia
on the Meander (and here, too, he mentioned the
bishop Damas), and another to the church in Tralles,
of which he relates that Polybius was then the ruler.
In addition to these he also wrote to the churcb at
Rome, and to it he extended the request that they
should not deprive him of the hope for which he
longed by begging him off from his martyrdom. It

is worth while appending a short extract from this
in support οf what has been said. Ηe writes as
follows: “ From Syria to Rome I am fighting with
wild beasts, by land and sea, by night and day,
bound to ten ‘ leopards ’ (that is, a company οf
soldiers), and they become worse for kind treatment.
Νow I become the more a disciple for their ill deeds,
‘ but not by this am I justified. ’ I long for the
beasts that are prepared for me ; and I pray that
they may be found prompt for me ; I will even entice
them to devour me promptly ; not as has happened
to some whom they have not touched from fear ;
even if they be unwilling of themselves, I will force
them to it. Grant me this favour. I know what
is expcdient for me ; now I am beginning to be a
disciple. May I envy nothing of things seen οr unseen
that 1 may attain to Jesus christ. Let there come
οn me fire, and cross, and struggles with wild beasts,
cutting, and tearing asunder, rackings of bones,
mangling of limbs, crushing οf my whole nody, cruel
tortures οf the devil, may I but attain to Jesus
Christ.”</p>
<p>This he put into words from the city mentioned to
the churehes named. When he had already passed
beyond Smyrna he also again conversed in writing
from Troas with those in Philadelphia and with the
church of the Smyrnaeans, and especially with Polycarp
who was then the head of this church. Ηe
knew well that Polycarp was an apostolic man and
like a true and good shepherd commends the flock
at Antioch to him, asking him to be zealous in his
care for it. Ηe also wrote to the Smyranaeans quoting
words from I know not what source and discoursing

They spread the preaching and scattered the saving

disciples, smitten in the soul by the divine Logos

first fulfilled the Saviour's command and distributed
their property to the needy, then, starting on their
ourney, took up the work of evangelists and were
zealous to preach to all who had not yet heard the
word of the faith, and to transmit the writhing of the
divine Gospels. Αs soon as they had no more than
laid the foundations of the faith in some strange
place, they appointed others as shepherds and
had been just brought in, but they themselves

such writings, of course, were the letters of Ignatius
of which we gave the list, and the Εpistle of Clement
which is recognized by all, which he wrote in the
name of the church of the Romans to that οf the
Corinthians. In this he has many thoughts parallel
to the Εpistle to the Ηebrews, and aetuahy makes
some verbal quotations from it showing elearly that
it was not a recent production, and for this reason,
too, it has seemed natural to include it among the
οther writings of the Apostle. For Ρaul had Spoken
in writing to the Ηebrews in their native language,
and some say that the evangelist Luke, others
that this same Clement translated the writing.
Αnd the truth οf this would be supported by the
similarity of style preserved by the Epistle of Clement
and that to the Hebrewss, and by the little difference

their traditions in his writings. Let this suffice to
good purpose. But it is worth while to add to the
words of Papias already given other sayings οf his,
in which he tells certain marvels and other details
which apparently reached him by tradition. It has
already been mentioned that Philip the Αpostle
lived at Ηierapolis with his daughters, but it must
now be shown how Ρapias was with them and reeeived
a wonderful story from the daughters of Ρhilip; for
he relates the resurrection of a corpse in his time
and in another Ρlace another miraele conneeted with
Justus surnamed Barsabas, for he drank poiSon but
by the Lord's graee suffered no harm. Of this
Justus the Αcts relates that the sacred Apostles
set him up and prayed over him together with
Matthias after the ascension of the Lord for the
choice of one to fill up their number in place of the
traitor Judas, “and they set forth two, Joseph
called Barsabas, who was called Justus, and Matthias ;
and they prayed and said." The same
adduees other accounts, as though they came to
him from unwritten tradition, and some strange
parables and teachings of the saviour, and some
other more mythical accountS. Αmong them he
says that there will be a millennium after the resurrection
of the dead, when the kingdom of Christ
will be set up in material form on this earth. I
suppose that he got these notions by a perverse

<p>reading οf the apostolic aceounts, not realiring that
they had spoken mystically and symbolically. For
he was a man of very little intelligence, as is clear
from his books. But he is responsible for the fact
that so many Christian writers after him held the
same opinion, relying on his antiquity, for inrtance
Irenaeus and whoever else appears to have held the
same views.</p>
<p>In the same writing he also quotes other interpretations
of the words οf the Lord given by the
Aristion mentioned above and traditions of John
the presbyter. To them we may dismiss the studious;
but we are now obliged to append to the words
already quoted from him a tradtion about the
Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he expounds as
follows. “ Αnd the Presbyter used to say tffihls,
Mark became Ρeter’s interpreter and wrote accurately
all that he remembered, not, indeed, in order,
of the things said or done by the Lord. For he had
not heard the Lord, nor had he followed him, but
later on, as I said, followed Ρeter, who used to
give teaching as necessity demanded but not making,
as it were, an auangement of the Lord's oracles, so
that Mark did nothing wrong in thus writing down
single Ρoints as he remembered them. For to one
tHhIng he gave attention, to leave out nothing of what
he had heard and to make no false statements in
them.' " This is related by Ρapias about Mark,
and about Matthew this was said, “ Matthew
collected the oracles in the Ηebrew language, and
eaeh interpreted them as best he could.”</p>

tioned a little earlier, passed away, and Primus, the
fourth from the Apostles, received the charge of
those in that place. Αt this time, too, at Rome
Alexander, when Evarestus had completed his eighth
year, was the Rfth to succeed Feter and Paul, and
took up the bishopric.</p>
<p>II. While the teaching of our Saviour and the
church were nourishing daily and moving on to
further progress the tragedy of the Jews was reaching
the climax of successive woes. Ιn the course of the
eighteenth year 3 οf the reign of the Emperor a
rebellion of the Jews again broke out and destroyed
a great multitude of them. For both in Alexandria
and in the rest of Egypt and especially in Cyrene,
as though they had been seized by some terrible
spirit of rebellion, they rushed into sedition against
their Greek fellow clblens, and increasing the seope
of the rebellion in the following year started a great
war while Lupus was governor of all Egypt. 4 In
the nrst engagement they happened to overcome

and killed the Jews in the city, but though thus
losing the help of the townsmen, the Jews of Cyrene
continued to plunder the countr y of Egypt and to
ravage the districts in it under their leader Lucuas.
The Emperor sent against them Marcius Turbo with
land and sea forces including eavalry. Ηe waged
war vigorously against them in many bartleS for a
considerable time and killed many thousands of Jews,
not οnly those of Cyrene but alSo those of Εgypt
who had rallied to Lucuas, 1 their king. The Εmperor
suspected that the Jews in Mesopotamia wollld also
attack the inhabitants and ordered Lusius Quietus
to clean them out of the province. Ηe organized a
force and murdered a great multitude of the Jews
there, and for this reform was appointed governor
of Judaea by the Εmperοr. The Greek authors 2 who

since the Jewiril bishops then ceased, it is now
necessary to give their names from the beginning.
The first then was James who was called the Lord's

third was Justus, Zacchaeus was the fourth, Tobias
the fifth, the sixth Benjamin, the seventh John, the
eighth Mattias, the ninth Philip, the telrth Seneca,

Ephres, the fourteenth Joseph, and last of all the
fifteenth Judas. such were the bishops in tbe crty

the Seventh from the Apostles, suceeeded Xystus

The War reaehed itS height in the eighteenth year of
the reign of Hadrian in Beththera, 1 which was a strong
eitadel not very rar from Jerusalem; the siege lasted a
long time before the rebels were driven to final destruction
by famine and thirst and the instigator of their
madness paid the penalty he deserved. Hadrian then
commanded that by a legal decree and ordinances the
whole nation should be absolutely prevented from
entering from theneeforth even the distriet round
Jerusalem, So that not eVen from a distance couhl lt
see it ancestral home. Ariston of Pella tells the
story. 2 Thus when the city came to be bereft of the
natlon of the Jews, and its ancient inhabitants had
completely perished, it was colonized by foreigners,
and the Roman city which afterwards arose changed
its name, and in honour of the reigning emperor
Αelius Hadrian was ealled Aelia. The chureh, too,
in it was composed of Gentiles, and after the Jewish
bishops the first who was appointed to minister to
those there was Marcus.</p>

all mankind, when the devil who hates what is good,

salvation, turned all his devices against the church.

Formerly he had used persecutions from without as
his weapon against her, but now that he was excluded
from this he employed wicked men and sorcerers,
like baleful weapons and ministers of destruction
against the soul, and eonducted his campaign by
other plotting by every means that sorcerers
and deeeivers might assume the same name as our
religion and at οne time lead to the depth of destruction
those οf the faithful whom they caught,
and at others, by the deeds whieh thev undertook,
might turn away from the path to the saving word
those who were ignorant of the faith. Thus from
Menander, whom we have already mentioned as the
successor οf Simon, there proceeded a certain snakelike
power with two mouths and double head, and
established the leaders of two heresies, Saturninus,
an Antionchian by race, and Basilides of Αlexandria.
The first established schools of impious heresy
syria, the latter in Εgypt. Irenaeus makes it plain
that Saturninus uttered for the most part the same
falsehoods as Menander, but Basilides, under the
pretext of secret doctrine, Stretehed fancy infinitely
far, fabricating monstrous mythS for his impious
heresy. Now while mort of the orthodox at that
time were struggling for the truth, and fighting
with great eloquence 1 for the glory of the Apostles
and of the Church, some also by their writings
provided for their successors methods of defence
against the heresies which have been mentioned.

Cabbas and Bar Coph, 1 and that he set up some others

invented barbarous names for them to astonish those

there vas no harm in eating things offered to idols,
or in light-heartedly denying the faith in times of
persecution. Like Pythagoras he enjoined those who
came to him to keep silence for five years. The
same writer tells other similar things about Basilides,
and offers a magnificent refutation of the error of
the heresy described. Irenaeus also writes that
Carpocrates was a contemporary of these, the father
of another herey which was called that of the
Gnoistics. These did not, like Barilides, derire to
transmit the magie of Simon secreriy but Openly, a

to perdition of those who were thus deceived by
them, and brought much weight of discredit upon
the divine word among the unbelieving Gentiles,
because the report Whieh started from them was
scattered calumniously on the whole race Of Christians.
It was especially in this way that it came to
pass that a blasphemous and wicked suspicion concerning
us was spread among the heathen of those
days, to the effect that we practised unspeakable
incest with mothers and sisters and took part in
wicked food. 1 Yet this did not long succeed, for the
truth vindicated itself and as time went on shone
ever more brighriy. For by its power the machinations
of its enemie were refuted; though new
heresies were invented one after another, the earlier
ones flowed into strange multiple and multifarious
forms and perished in different ways at different
times. But the brightness of the universal and only
true church proceeded to increase in greatness, for
it ever held to the same points in the same way,
and radiated forth to all the race οf Greeks and
barbarians the reVerent, sincere, and free nature,
and the sobriety and purity of the divine teaching
as to conduct and thought. Thus with the lapse of
time the calumnies against the whole teaching were
extinguished, and our doetrine remained as the only
one which had power among all and was admitted
to excel in its godliness and sobriety, 2 and its divine

in the simplest style of writing the unerring tradition
of the apostolic preaching. Ηe indicates the time
in which he flourished by writing thus about those
who had made idols : “To them they made cenotaphs <lb n="2"/>

Antinous, a slave of the Emperor Hadrian, in whose
honour the Antinoian games are held, though he was

Αt the same time too, Justm; a genuine lover of
true philosophy, was still continuing to practise the
learning of the Greeks. And he also himself indicates
this period in his Apology to Antoninus by
writing thus, “And we thought it not out of place
to mention at this point Antinous of the present
day whom all were intimidated to worship as a
god, though they knew his nature and origin.”</p>

<p>The same writer mentions the war of that time
against the Jews and makes this observation, “For in
the present Jewish war it was only Christians whom
nar Chocheba, the leader of the rebellion of the Jews,
commanded to be punished severely, if they did not
deny Jesus as the Messiah and blaspheme him.”</p>
<p>In the same book he shows that his conversion
from Greek philosophy to true religion did not take
place irrationally, but as an act of deliberate judgment;
for he writes thus : “For I myself, while I
was rejoicing in the teaching of Plato, heard the
Christians abused. But 1 saw that they were afraid
neither of death, nor οf anything usually thought
feadul, and I considered it was impossible that they
were living in wickedness and liberinism. For what
libertine or incontinent person, or οne who ands
good in the eating of human flesh, could greet death,
that it might take away all his lusts, and would not
try to prolong by all means his present life and to
avoid the notice οf the rulers, and not give himself
up to be murdered ?”</p>
<p>Moreover, the same writer relates that Hadrian
received a dispatch in favour of the Christians from
Serennius Graninaus, a most distinguished governor,
to the effect that it was not just to put them to
death, without accusation or trial, to appease popular
clamour, and that he wrote an answer to Minucius
Fundanus, proconsul of Asia, οrdering him to try no
one without inffictment and reasonable accusation,

remarks: “Though we might have begged you to
οrder trials to be held, as we desired, οn the strength
of a letter from the great and glorious Emperor
Hadrian, we preferrred to rest our request not on the
command of Ηadrian but on our knowledge that we
are making a righteous request. However, we also
append a copy of the letter of Hadrian, that you
may know that we are speaking the truth on this
point, and here it is.”</p>

itself, but we have translated it to the best of our

clear case οn these lines against the Christians so
as to plead it in open court, let them be influenced
by this alone and not by opinions or mere outeries.
For it is far more correct if anyone wishes to make
an accusation for you to examine this point. If then
anyone accuses them, and shows that they are acting
illegally, deeide the point according to the nature of
the offence, but by Hercules, if anyone brings the
matter forward for the purpose of blackmail, investigate

<p>X. After twenty-one years Hadrian paid the debt
of nature, aud Antoninus, called Pius, received the
sovereignty of ROnle. In his first year Telesphorus
passed away in the eleventh year of his ministry, and
Hyginus received the lot of the bishopric of the
Romans. Irenaeus relates that Telesphorus gained
renown in his death by martyrdom, and states in the

bishop of Rome, Valentinus, the founder
of a special heresy, and Cerdo, the founder of the
Marcionite error, were both famous in Rome Ηe

the same way, sometimes teaching heresy, sometimes

Hegesippus states that he stayed in Rome and remained
there until the episcopate of Eleutherus. Ιn
their time Justin vas at the height of his fame; in
the garb or philosopher he served as ambassador of
the word of God and contended in his writings for
the faith. Ηe wrote a treatise against Marcion and
mentions that at the time he was writing the heretic
was ahve and nororious. Ηe speaks thus : “Αnd
there was a certain Μarcion of Pontus who even
now is still teaching those who believe him to think
that there is another God greater than the creator.
Throughout the Whole race of men by the instigation
of demons he has made many to speak blasphemously
and to deny that the Maker of this universe is the
Father of Christ, and to confess that there is another
greater than He. Αll those who begin from them,
as we said, are called Christians just as the name
of philosophy is common to philosophers though
their doctrines ” Ηe goes on to say, “Αnd
we have a trearise against all the heresies which
have arisen which we will give to any who wish to
study it.”</p>
<p>The same Justin laboured powerfully against the
Oentiles, and addressed other arguments, affording a
defence for our faith, to the Emperor Antoninus,
called Ρius, and to the senate of the Romans, for he
was living in Rome. In his Apology he explains his
position and origin as follows: XII. “To the Emperor

some difficulty as to the day of the Passover. The
same writer tells another story about Polycarp which
it is necessary to add to what has been said about
him It runs as follows :</p>
<p>From the third book of Irenaeus against Heresies</p>
<p>“Αnd Ρolycarp also was not only instructed by
apostles and conversed with many who had seen the
Lord, but was also appointed bishop by apostles in
Asia in the church in smyma. We also saw him in
our childhood, for he lived a long time and extreme extreme
old age passed from life, a splenffid and glorious
martyr. Ηe conrtantly taught those things which
he had leamt from the apostles, which also are the
traffidItion of the church, which alone are true. To
these facts all the churehes in Αsia bear witness, and
the present successors of Ρolycarp, and he iS a far
more trustworthy and reliable witness of the truth
than valentinus and Marcion and the others who
hold wrong opinions. Ιn the time οf Αnicetus he
visited Rome and converted many of the abovementioned
heretics to the church of God, preaching
that the one and only truth which he had received
from the apostles was that which is the tradition of
the church. Αnd there are those who heard him tell
that John the ffisciple of the Lord Went in Εphesus
to bathe and seeing Cerinthus within, sprang out of
the baths without bathing calling οut, ‘Let us ny
lest the baths fall in, since Cerinthus, the enemy of

not even to join in conversation vith any of those
who mutilate the truth, as Ρaul also said, ‘A man

being self-condemned. ’ There is also a most powerful
letter of ’s written to the Philippians,
from which those who wish and care for their own
salvation can learn both the character of his faith
and the preaching of the ” so says Irenaeus.
Moreover, Ρolycarp, in his above-mentioned lerter to
the Philippians, which is still extant, has made some
quotations from the first Epistle of Peter.1</p>
<p>Antoninus, called Pius, held the sovereignty for
twenty-two years 2 and was succeeded by Mareus
Aurelius Verus, also called Antoninus, his son, together
with his brother Lucius. XV. Αt this time3
Polycarp was consecrated by martyrdom when great
persecutions again ffisturbed Αsia, and I think it
most necessary to give in this history the account
of his end, which is still extant in writing. The
document purports to be from the ehureh of which
he was the leader, and gives to the neighbouring

to have pity on himself, he did not hesitate, but took
pains to drag the beast to himself, almost forcing
him and provoking him in order that he might be
the sooner free from an unjust and wicked life. Αt
his glorious death the whole crowd was amazed at
the God-loving martyr for his bravery, and at the
courage οf the whole race of Christians, and began
to howl out together, “ Kill the atheists ! Let
Ρolycarp be sent ” When a great uproar arose
at this cry, a certain native of Phrygia named
Quintus, lately arrived from Ρhrygia, seeing the
beasts and the other threats, was overeome in his
mind and weakened and hnally abandoned his
salvation. The nauative of the above-mentioned
document showS that this man had rushed to
the tribunal with the others in a headstrong but
irreligious spirit ; but that nevertheless when he
was conricted he gave manifest proofs to all that
such men ought not to make foolhaffiy ventures
which do not spring from religion. Such was the fate
of these men. Vet the wonderful Polycarp, when
he nrst heard this, remained undisturbed, keeping
his mind steadfast and unmoved, and wished to Stay
there in the city. But the urgency of his friends
and their entreaty that he should go out persuaded
him, and he departed to a farm not far from the city
where he stayed with a few others, and night and
day ffid nothing but persevere in prayers to the Lord.
ln them he entreated and supplicated for peace,
begging that it be given the churcheS throughout
the world, for this was his invariable custom.

when he approached the proconsul asked him if he
were Ροlycarp, and when he admitted it he tried to
persuade him to deny, saying : ‘ Respect your age,’
and so forth, as thcy are accustomed to say : ‘ Swear
hy the genius of Caesar, repent, say : “ Αway with

looked οn all the crowd in the arena, and
waving his hand at them, he groaned and looked up
to heaven and said : ‘ Αway with the Αtheists.’
But when the Governor pressed him and said :
‘ Take the oath and I will let you go, revile Christ, ’
Polycarp said : ‘ For eighty and six years have I
becn his servant, and he has done me no wrong, and
how can I blaspheme my King who saved me ? ’
nut when he persisted again, and said : ‘ Swear by
the genius 1 of Caesar, ’ he said : ‘If you vainly
suppose that I will swear by the genius of Caesar,
as you say, and pretend that you are ignorant who

wish to leam the doctrine of Christianity fix a day

render honour, as is meet, if it hurt us not, to princes
and authorities appointed by God ; but as for those,
I do not count them worthy that a defence should be

change your mind.’ Αnd he said : ‘ Call for

the beasts, unless you repent.’ But Polycarp said
‘ You threaten with the fire that burns for a time,
and is quickly quenched, for you do not know the
fire which awaits the wicked in the judgement to
come and in everlasting punishment. But why are
you waiting? Come, do what you will.’ Αnd

that it not Only did not fall with trouble at the
things said to him, but that the proconsul, on the
other hand, was astounded and sent his herald into
the midst of the arena to announce three times :
‘Polycarp has confessed that he is a Christian.’
When this had been said by the herald, all the
multitude of heathen and Jews living in Smgrna
cried out with uncontrollable wrath and a loud
Shout : ‘This is the teacher of Asia, the father of
the Christians, the destroyer οf our Gods, who
teaches many neither to offer saeiffice nor to worship.’
Αnd when they said this, they cried out and asked
Philip the Asiarch to let loose a lion on Polycarp.
But he said he could not legally do this, since he
had closed the sports. Then they found it good to
cry out with one mind that he should burn Polycarp
alive, for the vision which had appeared to him on
his pillow must be fulffiled, ben he saw it burning,
while he was praying and he turned and said prophetically
phetically to those of the faithful who were with
him, ‘I murt be burnt alive.’ These things
happened with so great speed, quicker than it takes

Governor not to give his body, ἴ’ ‘lest,,’ he

when we were going to take it from the fire, for
they do not know that we shall not ever be able
either to abandon Christ, who suffered for the salvation
of those Who are being saved in the whole world,

Son of God, but the martyrs we love as disciples and
imitators οf the Lord ; and rightly, beeause of their
unsurpassable affection toward their own King and
Teacher. Ood grant that We too may be their companions
and fellow-disciples. When therefore the
centurion saw the contentionusness caused by the
Jews, he put the body in the midst, as was their
custom, and burnt it. Thus we, at last, took up his
bones, more Ρrecious than precious stones, and hner
than gold, and put them where it was meet. There
the Lord will permit us to come together according

of the church at Smyrna have given the story in
their Ietter which we have quoted. In the same
document concerning him other martyrdoms are
appended which took place in the same Smyrna at
the same time as the martyrdom of Polycarp, and
among them Metrodorus, who seems to have been a
presbyter of the Marcionite error, was given to the
fire and put to death. Α famous martyr of those at
that time was Pionius. The document concerning
him gives a full aceount of his speeial confession, his
boldness of speech, the instructive apologies for the
faith and popular addresses before the people and
magistrates, as well as the correction and comfort
to those who had succumbed to temptation in the
persecution, which he addressed during his imprisonment
to the brethren who visited him, in adffition to
this the tortures which he underwent, added to pain,
nailing, the enduring of the name, and, after all his
marvellous deeds, his death ; and to it we will refer
those interested, for it is ineluded in the martyrdoms
of the ancients colleeted by us.1 There are also
memoirs extant of οthers who were martyred in the
city of Ρergamοn in Αsia, Carpus and Ρapylas, and a
woman, Agathounice, who died after many glorious
confessions.</p>

the name of cynic which he bore, instigated the plot
against him, for Justin had often dereated him in
debate in the presence of hearers, and finally bound
on himself the trophies of victory by his martyrdom

have been mentioned, and to be stretched on the

‘ philosopher’ seeing that he publicly testifies
what he does not know, to the effect that the Christians
are atheists and impious, aud he does this to gain
the grace and pleasure of the many who have been
deceived. For either he controverts us without
attending to the teachings of Christ, and is a complete
rascal and far worse than the uneducated, who often
avoid discussing and giving false testimony on subjects
jects of which they have no knowledge; and if he
has studied and does not understand the greatness
in them, or though be does understand them is base
enough to do what he does to avoid suspicion, he is
more ignoble and rescally, for he succumbs to
ignorant and unreasonable opinion and fear. For I
would have you to know that Ι put forward and
asked him certain questions Of this kind in order to

trained in the learning of the Greeks and gained
great distinction in it and has left many monuments

Justin rightly exclaimed that those mentinoned

philosophers, he proceeds: “ Crescens, who lurked in
the great city, surpassed all in unnatural rice and was

counselled others to despise death but himself was
so afraid οf it that he intrigued to inffict death on
Justin, as though it were a great evil, because Justin
by preaching the truth convicted the philosophers as

ask him thiS one thing, Whether he was a ChriStian.
Αnd Ptolemy, being a lover of the truth, and not

was a Christian. The centurion caused him to be

οf the apostle. Αnd he also quotes some texts from
the prophets bringing the charge against Trypho
that the Jews had eut them out of the scripture.
There are also many works of his extant among
many Christians, and thus the books of this writer
seemed even to the aneients worthy οf study, for
Irenaeus quotes his works, doing so in the fourth book
Against Heresies in these very words: “ Αnd well does
Justin say in his treatise against Marcion that he
would not have believed the Lord himself had he
preached a God other than the Creator.” Again,
the fifth book οf the same treatise he quotes him as
follows: “ Αnd well did Justin say that before the
coming of the Lord satan dared not blaspheme God,
seeing that he ffid not yet know his ”
These points must serve to encourage students to
folow his arguments zealously and such are the facts

down to us. In them he explriaIns how when travelling
as far as Rome he mingled with many bishops and
that he found the same doctrine among them all.
But it is well to listen to What he said after some
remarks about the epistle of Clement to the
Corinthians: “ Αnd the chureh οf the Corinthians
remained in the truc doctrine until Ρrimus was
bishop of Corinth, and I conversed with them οn my

<p>XXIII. Concerning Dionysius it must Rrst be said
that he was appointed to the throne of the episcopate
of the diocese of Corinth, and that he communicated
his divine industry ungrudgingly not only to those
under him but aho to those at a distance, rendering
himself most useful to all in the general epistles
which he drew up for the churches. 1 Αmοng them
the lerter to the Lacedaemonians is an instrunction
in orthodoxy on the subject of peace and unity, and
the letter to the Athenians is a call to faith and to
life according to the gospel, and for despising this
he rehukes them as all but apostates from the truth
since the martyrdom οf Publius, 2 their leader, in the
persecution οf that time. Ηe mentions that Quadratus
was appointed their bishop after the martyrdom
οf Publius and testffies that through his zeal they
had bcen brought together and received a rerival of
their faith. Moreover, he mentions that Dionysius
the Areopagite was converted by the Αpostle Ρaul
to the frialth, accorffing to the narrative in the Αcts,
and was the first to be appointed to the bishoprie of
the diocese of Αthens. There is another extant
Ietter of his to the Nicomedians in which he
the heresy of Marcion and compares it with the rure
ofthe truth. Ηe also mote to the ehurch sojourning

he enjoins care against heretical error. He also
wrote to the church sojourning in Amastris, together
with the churches in Pontus, and mentions that
Bacchylides and Elpistus had urged him to write;
he adduces interpretations of the divine scriptures,
and mentions by name their bishop Palmas. Ηe
gave them many exhortations about marriage and
chastity, and orders them to receive those who are
converted from any backsliding, whether of conduct
or heretical To this list has been added
another epistle to Cnossus, in which he exhorts
Pinytos, the bishop of the diocese, not to put on the
brethren a heavy compulsory burden concerning
chastity and to consider the weaknesses of the many.
To this Pinytos replied that he admircd and welcomed
Dionysius, but exhorted him in turn to provide at
some time more solid food, and to nourish the people
under him with another more advanced letter, so
that they might not be fed continually on milky
words, and be caught unaware by old age Vbile still

bounty distributed to the saints and by exhorting
with his blessed words the brethren who come to
Rome, as a loving father would his children.”</p>

Clement to the Corinthians, showing that from the
beginning it had been the custom to read it in the
church. “ To-day we observed the holy day of the
Lord, and read out your letter, whieh we shall
continue to read from time to time for our admonition,
as we do with that which was formerly sent to
us through Clement.” 2</p>
<p>The same writer speaks as follows about the falsification
of his owh letters. “ When Christians asked me
to write letters Ι wrote them, and the apostles of
the derivll have filled them with tares, by leaving out
some things and putting in others. But woe awaits
them. Therefore it is no wonder that some have
gone about to falsify even the scriptures of the Lord
When they have plotted against writings so inferior.”</p>
<p>Besides these there is extant another lerter of
Dionysius to Chrysophora, a most faithful Christian,

of Soter and the Ιetter of clement as coming from the church

<p>XXIV. Of Theophilus, whom we have mentioned
as bishop of the church of the Antiochians, three
elementary treatises are extant, addressed to
Autolycus, and another with the title, Against the
Heresy of Hermogenes, in which he has quoted the
Apocalypse of John, and there are also extant some
οther books οf his on instruction. Heretics were
evcn then no less defiling the pure seed of apostolic
teaching like tares, and the shepherds ofthe churches
in every place, as though driving off wild beasts from
Christ's sheep, excluded them at one time by rebukes
and exhortations to the brethren, at another by their
more complete exposure, by unwritten and personal
inquiry and conversation, and ultimately correcting
their opinions by accurate arguments in written
treatises. It is elear that Theophilus joined with the
others in this campaign against them from a noble
trcatise whieh he made against Marcion, which has
heen preserved until now with the others that we
have mentioned. His successor in the church οf the
Antiochians was Maximinus, seventh from theapostles.</p>

there was a great discussion about the Passover,
which fell according to the season in those days, and
this was written.” Clement of Alexandria
this treatise in his own Οn the Passover, which he
says that he compiled in consequence of the writing
of Melito. Αnd in the book to the emperor he
relates that in his time we were treated as follows :
“ Ιt has never before happened as it is now that the
race of the religious should be persecuted and driven
about by new decrees throughout Αria. For shameless
informers and lovers of other people's property
have taken advantage of the decrees, and pillage us
openly, harrying night and day those who have done
nothing ” And after other points he says:
“ Αnd if this is done as your command, let it be
assumed that it. it is well done, for no righteous king
would ever have an unrighteous policy, and we gladly
bear the honour οf such death. But we submit to
you this single request, that you will first take
cognizance yourself of the authors of such strife, and
judge righteously whether they are worthy of death
and punishment, or of acquittal and immunity. But,
if it be not from you that there comes this counsel
and this new decree (and it would be improper even
against barbarian enemies), we beseech you all the
more not to neglect ust in this brigandage by a mob.”
Ηe then continues as follows: “Our philosophy first
grew up among the barbarians, but its full flower
came among your nation in the great reign of your
ancestor Augustus, and became an omen of good to
your empire, for from that time the power of the
Romans became great and splendid. You are now his

happy successor, and shall be so along with your son,1
if you protect the philosophy which grew up with the
empire and began with Αugustus. Your ancestors
nourished it together with the other cults, and the
greatest proof that our doctrine flourished for good
along with the empire in its noble beginning is the
fact that it met no evil in the reign of Αugustus, but
on the contrary everything splendid and glorious
according to the wishes of all men. 2 The only
emperors who were ever persuaded by malicious men
to slander our teaching were Νero and Domitian,
and from them arose the lie, and the unreasonable
custom of falsely accusing Christians. But their
ignorance was corrected by your pious fathers, who
wrote many rebukes to many, whenever any dared
to take new measures against Christians. Your
grandfather Hadrian shows this in his letters to
many, and especially to the proconsul Fundanus,
the governor οf Αsia, and your father, while you
were joined with him 3 in the administration οf the
world, wrote to the cities that no new measures
should be taken concerning us. Among these are
letters to the Larisians and to the Thessalonians and
the Athenians and to all the Greeks. sinee you
hold the same opinion about them and, indeed, one
which is far kinder and more philosophic, we are
persuaded οf your doing all which we beg of you.”</p>

scriptures of the ΟΙd Testament, whcih it is necessary
to enumerate here, and he writes as follows: “ Melito
to Onesimus his brother, greeting. Since you often
desired, in your zeal for the true word, to have
extracts from the Law and the Prophets concerning
the Saviour, and concerning all our faith, and, moreover,
since you wished to know the accurate facts
about the ancient writings, how many they are in
number, and what is their order, Ι have taken pains
to do thus, for Ι know your zeal for the faith and
interest in the word, and that in your struggle for
eternal salvation you esteem these things more
highly than all else in your love towards God.
Accordingly when I came to the east and reached
the place where these things were preached and
done, and learnt accurately the books of the Οld
Testament, Ι set down the facts and sent them to
you. These are their names : five books of Μoses,
Genesis, Exodus, Νumbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy,
Joshua the son of Νun, Judges, Ruth, four books of
Kingdoms, two books of Chronicles, the Ρsalms of
David, the Proverbs of Solomon and his Wisdom,
Ecclesiastes, the Song of Songs, Job, the prophets
Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Twelve in a single book,

Jerus, and after this the treatises which he wrote
against the heresy of the Phrygians, which had
begun its innovations not long before and was then,
as it were, beginning to sprout, while Montanus
with his false prophetesses 1 was making the beginnings
of the error.</p>
<p>XXVIII. Αnd of Musanus, whom we have mentioned
in a previous passage, there is extant a certain
very eloquent discourse which he wrote to some
Christians who had fallen away to the heresy of the
so-called Encratites, 2 which was at that time just
beginning to sprout and to introduce into life its
strange and corrupting false doctrine. XXIX. The
story goes that Tatian was the author of this error,
whose words we quoted a little above concerning the
marvellous Justin, and related that he was a disciple
of the martyr. Irenaeus states this in his first book,
Against the Heresies, and in the same place writes
thus concerning him and his heresy. “ The so-ealled
Encratites proceeding from Saturninus and Marcion
preached against marriage, annulling the original
creation of God, and tacitly condemning him who
made male and female. They also introduced abstention
from what they called ‘animate᾿ thigns in
ingratitude to the God who has made all things, and
they deny the salvation of the first created man.
This innovation was recently made by them when a
certain Tatian first introduced this blasphemy. Ηe
had been a hearer of Justin but so long as he was
with him, he produced nothing of this king, but after
the martyrdom of Justin he left the church, being

exalted by the idea of becoming a teacher and puffed
up as superior to others. He established his own type
of doctrine, telling stories of invisible Aeons, like the
followers of Valentinus, and rejecting marriage as
corruption and fornication similarly to Marcion and
Saturninus. Αnd as his own contribution he denied
the salvation of Αdam.’’ Irenaeus wrote thus at
that time. But a little later a certain man named
Severus strengthened the above mentioned heresy,
and is the reason why those who have sprung from
it obtained the name of Severiani from him. These
indeed use the Law and the Prophets and the
Gospels, though they interpret the facts of the sacred
scriptures in their own way, but they blaspheme the
Apostle ΡauΙ, and reject his epistles and do no
receive the Acts of the Apostles. Their former
leader Tatian composed in some way a combination
and collection of the gospels, and gave this the name
of The Diatessaron, 1 and this is still extant in
some places. And they say that he ventured to
paraphrase some words of the apostle, as though
correcting their style. Ηe has left a great number
of writings, οf which the most famous, quoted by
many, is his discourse Against the Greeks. Ιn it he
deals with primitive history, and shows that Moses
and the prophets of the Hebrews preceded all those
who are celebrated among the Greeks. This seems
to be the best and most helpful of all his writings.
Such are the facts of this period.</p>

<p>XXX. In the same reign heresies increased in
Mesopotamia, and Bardesanes, a most able man and
skilled in Syriac, composed ffidlalogues against the
Marcionites and other leaders of various opinions,
and he issued them in his own language and script,
together with many othcr οf his writings. Those
who knew them; and they were many, for he was a
powerful arguer, have translated them from Syriac
into Greek. Αmong them is his very powerful
dialogue with Antoninus Concerning Fate, and they say
that he wrote many οther works in conscquence of
the persecution of that time. Ηe had been first a
member of the Valentinians, but condemned this
school and refuted many oftheir fables, and himself
thought that he had changed to orthodox opinion,
but in fact he did not completely clean off the ffith
of his ancient heresy.</p>

<p>SORER, the bishop of the church of Rome, ended his
life in the eighth year οf his rule. To him succeeded
Elutherus, the twelfth from the apostles, and it was
the seventeenth year of the Emperor Antonius Verus.1
Ιn this time the persecution οf us in some parts of
the world was rekindled more violently by popular
violence in the cities, and, to judge from the events
in οne nation, myriads were distinguished by martyrdom.
The story has chanced to be handed down in
writing for posterity, and it is truly worthy of unceasing
remembrance. sincc the whole reeord of
its complete treatment has been embodied in our
collection οf martyrs, 2 and contains not merely the
narrahve itself but also an exposition οf doctrine,
I will at present select and quote merely such points
as belong to the present undertaking. Other writers
οf historical works have confined themselves to the
written tradition of victories in wars, of trimnphs οver
enemies, of the exploits of generals and the valour
of soldiers, men stained with blood and with countless
murders for the sake of children and country
and other possessions ; but it is wars most peaceful,

waged for the very peace of the sOul, and men who
therein have been valiant for truth rather than for
country, and for piety rather than for rileir dear
ones, that our reeord of those who order their lives
according to God will inscribe on everlasting monuments :
it is the struggles of the athletes of piety
and their valour which braved so much, trophies won
from demons, and victories against unseen adversaries,
and the crowns at the end of all, that it will
proclaim for everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p>1. Gaul was the country in which was prepared
the stage for these events. Its capital cities, famous
and more renowned than the others in the distriet,
were Lyolb and Vienne, through both of which passes
the river Rhone, flowing in an ample stream through
the whole district. The distingtliSlled churches of
this country sent the document about the martyrs
to the churches in Asia and Phrygia, in this way
recording what happedned among them, and I will
quote their words : “ The servants sojourning in
Vienne and Lyons in Gaul to the brethren in Αsia
and Phrygia, who have the same faith and hope of
redemption as you. Ρeace, grace, and glory from
God the Father and Jesus Christ, our Lord.”</p>
<p>Then after other prefatory remarks they begin
their narrative thus : “ The greatness of the persecution
here, and the terrible rage of the heathen
against the saints, and the suffering of the blessed
martyrs, are more than we can narrate accurately,

had gone so far that in spite οf his youth his reputation
was equal to that οf the elder Zacharias. 1 Ηe
walked in all the commanmnents and orffinances of
the Lord blameless and was unwearied in all ministrations
to his neighbours, having much zeal toward
God and being fervent in spirit. Ηis character forbade
him to endure the unreasonable judgement given
agninst us, and, overcome with indignation, he asked
to be heard himself in defence of the brethren to
the effect that there was nothing atheistic or impious
among us. Ηe was howled down by those around
the judgement-seat, for he was a man οf position, 2 and
the governor would not tolerate the just requests
which he had put forward but merely asked if he
were a Chrirtian hinBeK. Ηe then confessed in
clear tones and was himself taken into the ranks of
the martyrs. Ηe was called the ‘ Comforter of
Christians,’ but had the Comforter in himself,
spirit of Zacharias which he had shown by the fullness
of his love when he chose to Ιay down even his οwn
life for the defence of the brethren, for he was and

by uncertainty as to their confession, not fearillg the

ariested, completing their number, so as to collect
from the two churches all the zealous and those

and the rigour of his tortures to wring from
him something wrong, he resisted them with such
constancy that he did not even tell his own name,
or the race or the city whence be was, nor whether
he was slave or free, but to all questions answered
in Latin, ‘I am a Christian.’ This he said for
and city and race and for everything else, and the
heathen heard no other sound from him. For this
reason the governor and the torturers were very
ambitious to subdue him, so that when they bad
nothing left at all to do to him at last they fastened
plates of heated brass to the tenderest parts of his
body. His limbs were burnig, but he continued
himself unbending and unyielding, firm in his confession,
refreshed and strengthened by the heavenly
spring of the water of life which proceeds forth from
the body of Christ. His body was a witness to his
treatment it was all one wound and bruise,
wrenehed and torn out of human shape, but Christ
suffering in him manifested great glory, overthrowing
the adversary and showing for the example of the
others how there is nothing fearful where there is
the love of the Father nor painful where there is the
glory of Christ. For when the wicked after some

nothing of this kind happen, but, beyond all human
expectation, he raised himself up and his body was
straightened in the subsequent tortures, and he
regained his former appearance and the use of his

devil bring to torture (thinking that he had already
swallowed her up and wishing to condemn her through

as it were, woke up out of deep sleep, being reminded
through this transitory punishment of the eternal
torments in hell, and contradicted the blasphemers,
saying, ‘How would such men eat children, when
they are not allowed to eat the blood even of
irrational animals?’ And after this she confessed
herself a Christian and was added to the ranks of

<p>Αfter a few more sentences they go on again: “After
this the testimony of their death fell into every kind
of variety. For they wove various colours and all
kinds of Rowers into one wreath to offer to the
Father, and so it was necessary for the noble athletes
to undergo a varied conteSt, and after great victory
to receive the great crown of immortality. Maturus
and sanctus and Blandina and Αttalus were led forth
to the vild beasts, to the public, 1 and to a common
exhibition οf the inhumanity of the heathen, for the
day of fighting with beasts was specially appointed
for the Christians. Maturus and Sanctus passed again
through all torture in the amphitheatre as though
they had suffered nothing before, but rather as
though, having conquered the opponent in many
bouts, 2 they were now striving for his crown, οnce
more they ran the gauntlet in the accustomed
manner, endured the worrying of the wild beastS,
and everything which the maddened public, some in
οne way, some in another, were howling for and
commanding, finally, the iron chair on which the roasting
οf their own bodies clothed them with its reek.
Their persecutors did not stop even here, but went on
growing more and more furious, wishing to eonquer
their endurance, yet gained nothing from sanctus
beyond the sound of the confession Which he had
been accustomed to make from the beginning.</p>

in them through the great contest, they were at last
sacrificed, having been made a spectacle to the world
throughout that day as a substitute for all the
variations of gladiatorial eontests ; but Blandina was
hung on a stake and offered as a prey to the wild
beasts that were let in. She seemed to be hanging
in the shape of a croSS, and by her continuous prayer
gave great zeal to the combatants, while they looked
οn during the cntest, and with their outward eyes
saw in the form of their sister him who was crueffied
for them, to persuade those who believe on him that
all who suffer for the glory of Christ have for ever
fellowship with the living God Then when none of
the beasts Would touch her she was taken down
from the stake and brought baek into the jail, and
was thus preserved for another contest, in order that
by winning through more trials she might make
irrevocable the condemnation of the crooked serpent,
and might encourage the brethren ; for small and
weak and despised as she was, she had put on the
great and invincible athlete, Christ ; she had overcome
the adversary in many contests, and through

we could not bury the bodies in the earth, for night
did not avail us for this, nor did money persuade nor
entreaty shame, but in every way they watehed, as
though they would make some great gain, that the
bodies should not obtain burial.”</p>
<p>Further on they say : “ Thus the bodies οf the
martyrs, after having been exposed and insulted in
every way for six days, and afterwards burned and
turned to ashes, were swept by the wicked into the
river Rhone which flows near by, that not even a
relic of them might still appear upon the earth.
Αnd this they did as though they could coquer
God and take away their rebirth in order, as they
said, ‘ that they might not even have any hope of
resurrection, through trusting in which they have
brought in strange and new worship and despised
terrors, going readily and with joy to death ; now

been taken back from the beasts and were covered
with burns and scars and wounds, they neither proclaimed
themselves as martyrs, nor allowed us to
address them by this title. But if ever any one of
us called them martyrs either in a letter οr in speech
they rebuked him sharply. For they gladly conceded
the title of martyrdom to Christ, the frialthful
and true martyr 1 and first-born from the dead and
author of the life of God. Αnd they reminded us of
the martyrs who had already passed away, and said
‘they are already martyrs, whom Christ vouchsafed
to be taken up at their confession, and sealed their
witness by their departure, but we are lowly and
humble ’ 2 Αnd they besought the
brethren with tears, begging that earnest prayers
might be made for their consecration. The power
οf martyrdom they actually showed, having great
boldness towards the heathen, and they made plain
their nobleness by endurance and absence of fear or
timidity; but the title of martyr they refused from
the brethren, for they were filled with the fear οf
God.”</p>

It runs thus: There was among them a certain
Alcibiades, who was living a very austere life, and
at first was not partaking οf anything at all, but
used merely bread and water and was trying to
live thus even in the jail. But it was revealed to
Attalus after the first contest which he underwent
in the amphitheatre that Alcibiades was not doing
well in not making use οf the creations οf God, and
offering an example of offence 1 to others. Alcibiades
was persuaded and began to partake οf everything
without restraint and gave thanks to God; for they
were not without help from the grace of God but
the Ηoly Spirit was their counsellor. Let this suffice
for this point.</p>
<p>Just at that time the party οf Montanus and
Αleibiades and Theodotus in Ρhrygia began first to
engender among many their views concerning
prophecy (for the many other wonderful works of
the grace of God which Were still being wrought
up to that time in divers churches produced the
belief among many that they also were prophets),
and when dissension arose about the persons mentioned
the brethren in Gaul again formulated their
οwn judgement, pious and most orthodox, concerning
them, subjoining various letters from the martyrs
who had been consecrated among them, which letters
while they were still in prison they had composed
for the brethren in Αsia and Ρhrygia, and also for
Εleutherus, who was then bishop οf the Romans,
and so they were ambassadors for the sake οf the
peace of the churches.</p>

a presbyter of the diocese at Lyons, the same
martyrs commended to the afore-mentioned bishop

the miracle is related, but it was not confessed that
it happened through the prayers of the Christians;

friends of truth, what happened has been described
in a simply and harmless fashion. Αmong these

been saved by the Ρrayers of the Christians, and
Tertullian says that the emperor also threatened
death to those who attempted to accuse us. The
author goes on as fohows: “What kind of laws are
these which wicked, unrighteous, and cruel men use
against us alone? Vespasian did not observe them
although he conquered the Jews. Trajan partially
allowed them, but forbade Christians to be sought

matters, nor Pius, as he is called, ratified them.”

<p>When Ρothinus was consecrated with the martyrs
in Gaul at the age of full ninety years, Irenaeus
received the episcopacy οf the diocese in Lyons,1 of
which Ροthinus had been the head, and we have
been told that he had been a listener to Polycarp in
his early youth. In his third book against the
heresies he gives the succession οf the bishops in
Rome as far as Εleutherus, the events of whose days
are now being discussed by us, as though his book
had been composed at that time, and he gives the
list, writing as follows. VI. “Therefore when the
blessed apostles had found and built the church they
gave the ministry of the episcopate to Linus. Paul
mentioned this Linus in his epistle to Timothy.
Anencletus succeeded him, and after him Clement
obtained the episcopate in the third place from the
apostles. He had seen the blessed apostles and

still rang in his ears, their tradition was held before
his eyes. Nor was he alone in this, for there were still
many surviving at that time who had been taught
by the apostles. When in the time οf this Clement
no little dissenstion arose among the Chrirtians at
Corinth, the church in Rome sent a most powerful
letter to the Corinthians urging them to peace and
renewing their faith and the tradition which they
had recently received from the apostles.1”</p>

him Anicetus. Soter succeeded Anicetus, and now,

which came down to them about the canonical
Scriptures. Now Irenaeus was one of these, so let
us quote his words, and in the first place those which
refer to the saered Gospels, as follwos : “ Now
Matthew published among the Hebrews a written
gospel 1 also in their own tongue, while Ρeter
and Paul were preaching in Rome and founding the
church. But after their death Mark also, the disciple
and interpreter of Peter, himself handed down
to us in writing the things which were preached by
Ρeter, and Luke also, who was a follower of Paul,
put down in a book the gospel which was preached
by him. Then John, the disciple of the Lord, who
had even reted on his breast, himself also gave forth
the gospel, while he was living at Ephesus in Asia.”</p>

<p>These things were said by the writer referred to
in the third book of his treatise which has been
quoted before, and in the fifth book he discourses
thus about the Apocalypse of John and the number
of the name of the Antichrist.1 “ Now since this is
so, and since this number is found in all the good
and ancient copies, and sinee those Who have seem
John face to face testify, and reason teaches us that
the number of the name of the beast appears according
to the numeration of the Greeks by the letters
in it . . . ” Αnd going on later he says concerning
the same point, “ We therefore will not take the risk
of making any positive statement concerning the
name of the Antichrist. For if it had been necessary
for his name to have been announeed cleariy at the
present time, it would have been spoken by him
who also saw the Revelation ; for it was not even
seen a long time ago, but almost in our own generation
towards the end of the reign of Domitian.”</p>
<p>The author quoted says this about the Apocalypse,
and he also mentions the first Epistle of John,
making many quotations from it, and likewise the
first Epistle of Ρeter. Αnd he not only knew but
also received 2 the writing of the Shepherd, saying,
“ Well did the scripture say ‘ first of all believe that
God is one who created and fitted together all

all but verbally from the WiSdom of Solomon, “ Αnd
<note type="footnote">1 According to Rev. xiii. 18 the Νumber of the Beast is
666. The point is that in ancient times the letters of the
alphabet were used as numbers ; thus the writer means that
if the letters in the name of the Beart be taken as numbers
they will when added up amount to 666. The difficulty is
that with a little ingenuity this can be proved to be true of
almost any unpopular person. 2 i.e. as Scripture.</note>

<p>in the scriptures and in both languages, and God
thus wrought what he willed. But Ptolemy, wishing
to make trial of them in his own way, and being
afraid lest they should have made some agreement
to conceal by their translation the truth in the
Scriptures, separated them from one another and
commanded them all to write the same translation.
Αnd this he did in the case of all the books.
when they came together to Ptolemy, and compared
each his own translation, God was glorffied and
scriptures were recognized as truly divine, for they
all rendered the same things in the same words and
the same names, from beginning to end, so that even
the heathen who were present knew that the Scriptures
had been translated by the inspiration of God.
Αnd it is no marvel that God did this, for when the
Scriptures had been destroyed in the captivity οf the
people in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, and the Jews
had gone back to their country after seventy years,
then in the times of Artaxerxes, the king of the
Ρersians, he inspired Ezra, the priest of the tribe of
Levi, to restore all the sayingS of the prophets Who
had gone before, and to restore to the people the
law given by ” 1 so much sayS Irenaeus.</p>

<p>X. Αt that time a man very famous for his learning
named Pantaenus had charge of the life of
the faithful in Αlexandria, for from ancient custom
a school of sacred learning eristed among them.
This sehool has lasted on to our time, and we have
heard that it is managed by men powerful in their
learning and zeal for divine things, but tradition
says that at that time Pantaenus was especially
eminent, and that he had been influenced by the
philosophic system of those called stoics. They say
that he showed sueh Zeal in his warm disposition for
the divine word that he was appointed as a herald
for the goSpel of Christ to the heathen in the East,
and was sent as far as India. For indeed there Were
until then many evangelists of the word who had
forethought to use inspired zeal on the apostolic
model for the increases and the building up of the
divine word. Οne of these was Pantaenus, and it is
said that he went to the Indians, and the tradition is
that he found there that among some of those there
who had known Christ the Gospel according to
MattheW had preceded his coming ; for Bartholomew,
one of the apostles, had preached to them and had
left them the writing of Matthew in Hebrew letters,
which was preserved until the time mentioned.
Pantaenus, after many achievementS, was at the
head of the sehool in Alexandria until his death,
and orally and in writing expounded the treasures
of the divine doctrine.</p>

of the Ηoly Scriptures with Ρantaenus. Ιn the
Hypotyposes which he composed he mentioned
Pantaenus by name as his teacher, and he seems to
me to allude to him in the first book of the Stromateis,1
when he speaks thus in reference to the more distinguishedd
members of the apostolic sueeession which
he had received. “ This work is not a writing composed
for show, but notes stored up for my old age,
a remedy against forgetfulness, an image without
art, and a sketch of those clear and rital words which
<lb n="1"/> was privileged to hear, and οf blessed and truly
notable men. of these one, the Ionian, was in
Greece, another in South Italy, a third in CoeleSyria,2

in the Εast, οne οf them an Assyrian, another in
Palestine of Hebrew origin. But when I had met
the last, and in power he was indeed the first, <lb n="1"/>
hunted him out from his concealment in Egypt and
found rest. But these men preserved the true tradition

various books, among others especially one direeted
against the heresy of Marcion. Ηe says that it was
divided in his time into various opinions, and, describing
accurately those who had caused the
divergence, he refutes the fahe teaching devised by
each οf them. Listen then to him when he writes
thus : “ Therefore they have ceased to agree among
themselves, maintaining inconsistent opinions. One
of their herd is Αpelles, who is reverenced for his life
and old age. Ηe admits that there is one Principle,2
but says that the prophecies are of an opposing
spirit, and he was persuaded by the utteranees of a

two Principles. To them belong Ρotitus and Basilicus.

with Αpelles, and states it thus : “ For the οld man
Apelles when he consorted with us, was proved to
make many false statements. Hence also he used
to say that it is not necessary to investigate the
argument fully, but that eaeh should remain in his
own belief, for he asserted that those who placed
their hope on the Crucffied would be saved, if they
persisted in good works. But as we have srid before,
the most obseure part of all the doctrines which he
put forward were about God. For he kept on saying
that there is only one Principle just as our doctrine
” Then after expounding all his opinions he
goes on as follows: “ Αnd when I said to him,
where is this proof of yours, οr how can you say
that there is οne Ρrinciple ? Tell ’ he said that
the prophecies refute themselves by not having
spoken the truth at all, for they are inconsistent
and false and contradict themselves, but as to how
there is one Ρrinciple he said that he did not know
it, but merely inclined to that riew. Then when <lb n="1"/>
adjured him to to speak the truth he swore that he
was speaking the truth, when he said that he did
not know how the unbegotten God is one but that

did not know how to establish what he taught.”</p>

history has been left to us. One of these at the beginning

that he had also taken part in oral controversy against
them. Ηe writers a preface in this way : “ For a long

any lack of ability to refute the lie and testify to
the truth, but from timidity and seruples lest 1 might
seem to some to be adding to the writings or injunctions
οf the word of the new covenant οf the gospel,
to which no οne who has chosen to live according to
the gospel itself can add and from which he cannot
take away. But when I had just come to Ancyra
in Galatia and perceived that the chureh in that
place was torn in two by this new movement which
is not, as they call it, prophecy but much rather, as
will be shown, false prophecy, I disputed concerning
these people themselves and their propositions
so far as I could, with the Lord's help, for many
days continuously 2 in the church. Thus the church
rejoiced and was strengthened in the truth, but our
opponents were crushed for the moment and our
adversaries were ffirtressed. Therefore the presbyters

presbyter, was also present. Though we did not do
so, we promised to write from home if the Lord
permitted, and to send it to them speedily.”</p>
<p>Continuing with other similar remarks at the
beginning of his treatise, he proceeds to narrate as
follows the cause of the heresy rererred to : — “ Their
opposition and their recent heretical schism from the
church had the following origin. In Phrygian Μysia
there is said to be a Village called Ardabav. There
they say that a recent convert called Montanus, when
Gratus was proconsul of Asia, in the unbounded lust
of his sould for leadership gave access tp himself to
the adversary, became obsessed, and suddenly fell
into frenzy and convulsions. He began to be
ecstatic and to speak and to talk strangely, prophesying
contrary to the custom which belongs to the
tradition and succession of the church from the
beginning. Οf those who at that time heard these
bastard utterances some were vexed, thinking that
he was possessed by a devil and by a spirit of error,
and was disturbing the populace ; they rebuked
him, and forbade him to speak, remembering the
distinction made by the Lord, and his warning to
keep watchful guard against the coming οf the false
prophets ; but others, as though elevated by a holy
spirit and a prophetic gift, and not a little conceited,
forgot the Lord's distinction, and encouraged the
mind-injuring and seducing and people-misleading

could not be kept silent.1 But by some art, or rather
by such an evil scheme of artifice, the deVil wrought
destruction for the disobedient, and receiving unworthy
honours from them stimuhrted and inflamed
their understanding which was already dead to the
true faith ; so that he raised up two more women
and filled them with the bastard spirit so that they
spoke madly and improperly and strangely, like
Montanus. The spirit 2 gave blesrings to those who
rejoiced and were pround in him, and puffed them up
by the greatness of its promises. Yet sometimes it
flatly condemned them completely, wisely, and faithfully,
that it might seem to be critical, though but
few of the Phrygians were deceived. But when the
arrogant spirit taught to blaspheme the whole
Catholic church throughout the world, because the
spirit of false prophecy received from it neither
honour nor entrance, for the Christians of Asia after
assembling for this purpose many times and in many
parts of the province, tested the recent utterances,
pronounced them profane, and rejected the heresy,

called us murderers οf the prophets because we did
not receive their chattering prophets (for they say
that these are those whom the Lord promised to

Is there anyone, good people, of those whose talking
began with Montanus and the women, who was persecuted
by Jews οr killed by the wicked ? Νot one.
Or was there any οne of them who was taken and
crucified for the name ? Νo, there was not. Or was
any οne of the women ever scourged in the synagogues
of the Jews or stoned ? Νever anywhere. It was a
different death that Μontanus and Maximilla are said
to have died ; for the story goes that each οf them
was inspired by a mind-destroying spirit to commit
suicide, though not together, and there was much
gossip at the time of the death οf eaeh. But thus
it was that they died, and destroyed their lives like
the traitor Judas. So also general report says that

prophet, either of those in the Οld Testament or οf
those in the New, was inspired in this way ; they can
boast neither of Agabus, nor of Judas, nor of Silas,
nor of the daughters of Philip, nor of Ammia in
Philadelphia, nor of Quadratus, nor of any others
Who do not belong to ” And again after a
little he goes on, “ For if the Montanist women
succeeded to Quadratus and Ammia in Philadelphia
in the prophetic gift, let them show who among them
suceeeded the followers of Montanus and the women,
for the apostle grants that the prophetic gift shall
be in all the church until the final coming, but this
they could not show, seeing that this is already the
fourteenth year from the death of Maximilla.”</p>
<p>Ηe, therefore, so writes. But the Miltiades mentioned
by him has also left us other monuments of his
own zeal for the oracles of God in the treatises which

<p>XVIII. Apollonius also, a writer of the ehurch
when the so-called Montanist heresy was still
flourishing in Ρhrygia, composed a refutation and
published it as a separate work against them,
proving word by word that their alleged prophecies
are false and showing the true character of the life
of the leaders of the heresy. Listen to the actual
words which he uses about Montanus. “ But the
deeds and the teachings of this recent teaeher show
his eharaeter. Ιt is he Who taught the annulment
of marriage, who enacted fasts, who gave the name
οf Jerusalem to Pepuza and Tymion, which are little
towns in Phrygia, and wished to hold assemblies
there from everywhere, who appointed colleetors of
money, who organimd the receiving of gifts under
the name of offerings, who provided salaries for those
who preached his doctrine in order that its teaching
might prevail through gluttony.”</p>
<p>So he says about Montanus. Αnd a little further
on he writes thus about the Ρrophetesses. “ Thus
we prove that these first prophetesses themselves
deserted their husbands from the moment that they
were filled with the spirit. what a lie it is then for
them to call Ρriscilla a ” Then he goes on
saying : “Does not all Scripture seem to you to forbid
a prophet from receiving gifts and money 7. There-

about another of those who were honoured among
them as martyrs: “But in order that we may not
speak about more of them, let the prophetess 1 tell
us the story of Alexander, who calls himself a
martyr, with whom she joins in revels, to whom many
pay reverence. We need not tell of his robberies
and the other crimes for which he has been punished,
but the record-house 2 has them. Which then forgives
the ’s sins? Does the prophet absolve
the martyr of robbery or the martyr forgive the
prophet for avarice? For the Lord said, ‘Provide
neither gold nor silver nor two ’; but these,
doing wholly otherwise, have transgressed by the
acquisition of these forbidden things. For we will
show that their so-called prophets and martyrs make

from orphans and widows. Αnd if they have the
courage let them stop at this point and discuss these
matters in order that if they are convicted they may
at least cease transgressing for the future. For it
is necessary to test the fruits of the prophet, for
from the fruits the tree is known. But, that the
story of Alexander may be known to those who wish,
he was convicted by Aemilius Pompinus, proconsul
in Ephesus, not for being a Christian but for his
daring robberies, and he was an old offender. Then,
by falsely claiming the name of the Lord he was
released, having deceived the Christians there, and
his own diocese from which he came would not
receive him because he was a robber, and those
who wish to learn his story have the public records
of Asia at their disposition.1 The prophet is ignorant
about him though he lived with him for many years,
but we have exposed him, and through him expose
also the nature of the prophet. we can ShoW the

about their boasted prophets: “If they deny that
their prophets have taken gifts let them admit this,
that if they have been convicted, they are not true

it was forty years from the time when Montanus
plotted his fictitious prophecy, to the time when he
wrote his book. Αnd again he says that Zoticus,
whom the former writer mentioned, when Maximilla
pretended to prophesy in Pepuza had tried in
opporition to confute the spirit which worked in her,
but was prevented by those who agreed with her
Ηe also mentions a certain Thraseas 1 as one of the
martyrs οf that time. Moreover, he says, as though
from tradition, that the Sariour ordered his apostles
not to leave Jerusalem for twelve years. He also
makes quotations from the Apocalypse of John and
tells how by divine power a dead man was raised by
John himseK at Ephesus. Αnd he says other things
by which he demonstrated powertully and completely
the error of the heresy under discussion. so far

Evil, for Florinus seemed to be defending this
opinion. For his sake too, when he a attracted
by the Valentinian error, a work was composed by
Irenaeus On the Ogdoad,2 in which he also indicates
that he had himself received the first succession of
the apostles, and in it, at the end of the work, we
find a most acceptable notice from him which we
are obliged to give in this book and it runs as follows:

heard from them, and about their miracles, and
about their teaching, and how Polycarp had received
them from the eyewitnesses of the word of life,

I listened eagerly even then to these things

made notes Of them, not on paper but in my heart,
and ever by the grace of God do Ι truly ruminate
on them, and I can bear witness before God that if
that blessed and apostolic presbyter had heard anything
of this kind he would have cried out, and shut
his ears, and said according to his custom, ‘Ο good
God, to what time hast thou preserved me that I
should endure ?' Ηe would have fled even

he sent either to the neighbouring churches, strengthening

<p>XXIII. At thattime time no small controversy arose
because all the dioceses of Asia thought it right, as
though by more ancient tradition, to observe for the
feast of the Saniour's passover tbe fourteenth day
of the moon, on which the Jews had been commanded
to kill the lamb. Thus it was necessary to finish
tbe fast on that day, whatever day of the Week it
might be. 1 Υet it was not the custom to celebrate
in this manner in the churches throughout the rest
of the world, for from apostolic tradition they kept
the custom which still exists that it is not right to
finish tbe fast on any day save that of the resurrection
of our Saviour. Many meetings and conferences
with bishops were beld on this point, and all unanimously
formulated in their letters the doctrine
of the church for those in every country country that the
mystery of the Lord's resurrection from the dead
could be celebrated on no day save Sunday, 2 and

<p>Upon this Victor, who presided at Rome, immediately
tried to cut off from the common unity the
dioceses of all Αsia, together with the adjacent
churches, οn the ground of heterodoxy, and he
indited letters announcing that all the Christians
there were absolutely excommunicated. But by
no means all were pleased by this, so they isSued

peace and unity and love towards his neighbours.
Thcir words are extant, sharply rebuking victor.

he recommends that the mystery of the ’s
resurrection be observed only οn the Lord's day, yet
nevertheless exhorts victor suitably and at length
not to excommunicate whole churches of God for
following a traffidltion οf ancient custom, and eontinues
as follows: “For the controversy is not only about
the day, but also about the actual character οf the
fast; for some think that they ought to fast οne
day, others two, others even more, some count their
day as forty hours, day and night. 1 Αnd such variation

<p>XXVIII. In a treatise worked out by one of these
against the heresy of Αrtemon, which Ρaul of
Samosata has tried to renew in our time, there is
extant an account which bears οn the history which
we are examining. For he criticizes the abovementioned
heresy (which claims that the sarivlour
was a mere man) as a recent innovation, beeause
those who introduced it wished to make it respectable
as being ancient. Among many other points adduced
in refutation of their blasphemous falsehood, the
treatise rehtes this this: “For For they say that all who
went before and the apostles themselves received
and taught what they now say, and that the truth
of the teaching was preserved until the times οf
victor, who was the tffihlrteenth bishop in Rome after
Ρeter, but that the truth had been corrupted from
the time of his successor, Zephyrinus. What they
said might perhaps be plausible if in the nrst place
the dirine scriptures were not opposed to them, and
there are also writings of certain christians, older
than the time of Victor, wHch they wrote to the
Gentiles οn behalf of the truth and against the
heresies of their οwn time. 1 mean the works of
Justin and Miltiades and Tatian and Clement and
many others in all of which Christ is treated as God.

written by faithful Christians from the beginning
sing of the Christ as the LogoS of Ood and treat him
as God. Ηοw then is it possible that aftcr the mind
οf the church had been announced for so many years
that the generation before Victor can have Ρreached
as these say? Why are they not ashamed of so
calumniating Victor when they know quite well that
Victor excommunicated Theodotus the cobbler, the
founder and father of this insurrection which denie
God, when he nrst said that Christ was a mere man?

blasphemy teaches, how could he have thrown out
Theodotus who invented this heresy?”</p>

adds another incident which happened in the time
of Zephyrinus and wTites as follows: “I will at least
remind many of the brethren of an event whieh
happened in our time whieh I think would have
probably been a warning to the men of sodom had it
happened in their city. There Was a certain confessor,
Natalius, not long ago but in our own time.
Ηe was deceived by Asclepiodotus and by a second
Theodotus, a banker. These were both ffiscipleS of
Theodotus the cobbler, who was first excommunicated
by vietor, who, as I said, was then bishop, for this way

<p>1. Νow when Severus also was stirring up persecution
against the churches, in every place splendid martyrdoms
of the champions of piety were accomplished,
but with especial frequency at Alexandria. Thither,
as to some great arena, were escorted from Εgypt
and the whole Thebais God's champions, who, through
their most stedfast endurance in divers tortures and
modes of death, were wreathed with the crowns laid
up with God. Αmong these was Leonides, known as
“the father of Οrigen,’’ who was beheaded, leaving
his son behind him quite young. It will not be out
of place to deseribe briefly how deliberately the
mind was set on the Divine Word from that early
age, especially as the story about him has received
exceedingly widespread notoriety. II. Μany
indeed, would there be to say, if one were to attempt
at leisure to hand down in writing the man's life, and
the narrative concerning him would require also a
work of its own. Nevertheless, on the present
occasion abridging most things as briefly as may be,
we shall state some few of the facts concerning him,

gathering what we set forth from certain letters and
information derived from pupils of his, whose lives
have been preserved even to our day.</p>
<p>In the case of Origen I think that even the facts
from his very cradle,1 so to speak, are worthy
mention. For Severus was in the tenth year of his
reigh,2 and Laetus was governor of Alexandria
the rest of Εgypt, and Demetrius had just then
received the episcopate οf the communities there in
succession to Julian. When, therefore, the flame
οf persecution was kindled to a fierce blaze, and
countless numbers were being wreathed with the
crowns οf martyrdom, Origen's soul was
with such a passion for martyrdom, while he was still
quite a boy, that he was all eagerness to come to
close quarters with danger, and to leap forward and
rush into the conflict. In fact, it were but a very
little step and the end of his life was at hand, had
not the divine and heavenly providence, acting for
the general good through his mother, stood in the
way of his zeal. She, at all events, at first had
recourse to verbal entreaties, bidding him spare a
mother's feelings; then, when he learnt that his
father had been captured and was kept in prison,
and his whole being was set on the desire for martyrdom,
perceiving that his purpose was more resolute
than ever, she hid all his clothes, and so laid upon
him the necessity of remaining at home. Αnd since
nothing else remained for him to do, and a zeal,
intense beyond his years, suffered him not to be quiet,
he sent to his father a letter on martyrdom most
strongly urging him οn, in which he advises him in
these very words, saying : “Take care to to change

thy mind on account.’’ Let this be recorded as
the first proof of Origen's boyish readiness of mind
and genuine love of godliness. For indeed in the
study of the faith also he had already laid down a
good foundation, having been trained in the divine
Scriptures from the from the time that he was still a boy.
Certainly it was no ordinary amount of labour that
he bestowed on these, since his father, in addition
to the customary curriculum, took pains that these
also should be for him no secondary matter. On all
occasions, for example, he kept urging him before
beginning his secular1 lessons to train himself in
the sacred studies, exacting from him each day
learning by heart and repetition. Αnd this the boy
did with no lack of willingness, nay, he worked
with even excessive zeal at these studies, so that he
was not satisfied with reading the sacred words in a
simple and literal manner, but sought something
further, and busied himself, even at that age, with
deeper speculations, troubling his father by his
questions as to what could be the inner meaning of
the inspired Scripture. Αnd his father would rebuke
him ostensibly to his face, counselling him to seek
nothing beyond his years nor anything further than
the manifest meaning; but secretly in himself he
rejoiced greatly, and gave profound thanks to God,
the Αuthor of all good things, that Ηe had deemed
him worthy to be the father of such a boy. Αnd it
is said that many a time he would stand over the
sleeping boy and uncover his breast, as if a divine
spirit were enshrined therein, and kissing it with
reverence count himself happy in his goodly offspring.

These are the stories, and others akin to these, that
they tell about Origen's boyhood.</p>
<p>But when his father had been perfected by martyrdom,
he was left destitute with his mother and six
smaller brothers, when he was not quite seventeen.
His father's property was confiscated for the imperial
treasury, and he found himself, along with his
ralatives, in want of the necessaries of life. Yet he
was deemed worthy of divine aid, and met with
welcome and refreshment from a certain lady, very
rich in this world's goods, and otherwise distinguished,
who nevertheless was treating with honour a wellknown
person, one of the heretics at Alexandria at
that time Ηe was an Antiochene by race, but the
lady we have mentioned kept him at her house as
her adopted son, and treated him with especial
honour. But although Origen of necessity had to
consort with him, he used to give clear proofs of his
orthodoxy, at that age, in the faith. For though very
great numbers, not only of heretics but also of our
own people, were gathered together with Ρaul (for
that was the man's name), attracted by his apparent
skilfulness in speech, Origen could never be persuaded
to associate with him in prayer, keeping the rule οf
the Church, even from boyhood, and “loathing’’ —
the very word he himself uses somewhere—
teachings of the heresies. Ηis father had brought
him forward in secular studies, and after his death
he applied himself wholly with renewed zeal to a
literary training, so that he had a tolerable amount
οf pronciency in letters; and, not not after his
father's perfecting, by dint of application to these

studies, he was abundantly supplied, for a person of
his years, with the necessaries of of life.</p>
<p>III. Αnd while he was devoting himself to teaching,
as he himself informs us somewhere in writing, since
there was no one at Alexandria set apart for catechetical
instruction (for all had been driven away by
the threat of the persecution), some of the heathen
approached him to hear the word of God. Of these
Plutrach is pointed out as being the first, who after
a noble life was adorned also with a divine martyrdom;
and the second, Heraclas, Plutarch's brother. Ηe also,
in his own person, afforded a noteworthy example of
a philosophic life and of discipline, and was deemed
worthy of the bishopric of Αlexandrians in succession
to Demetrius. Origen was in his eighteenth
year 1 when he came to preside over the catechetical
school, and at this time also he came into prominence
when the persecutions were going on under Aquila,
the governor of Alexandria.2 Then also he won
himself an exceedingly wide reputation among all
those who were οf the faith, by the kindly help and
goodwill that he displayed towards all the holy
martyrs, unknown and known alike. For he was
present not only with the holy martyrs who were
in prison, not only with those who were under examination
right up to the final sentence, but also
when they were being led away afterwards to their
death, using great boldness and coming to close
quarters with danger; so that, as he courageously
drew near and with great boldness greeted the
martyrs with a kiss, many a time the heathen
multitude round about in its fury went near to
stoning him, but for the fact that time after time he
found the divine right hand to help him, and so

escaped marvellously; and this same divine and
heavenly grace οn other occasions again and —
it is impossible to say how οften—Ρreserved him
safely, when plots were laid against him at that time
because of his excessive Ζeal and boldness for the
word of Christ. Αnd so great, then, was the war of
unbelievers against him, that soldiers were placed in
groups for his protection 1 round the house where he
abode, because of the number of those who were
receiving instruction from him in the sacred faith.
Thus day by day the persecution against him blazed,
so that there was no longer any place for him in the
whole city; from house to house he passed, but was
driven from all sides, on account of the numbers who
through him came οver to the divine teaching. For
in his practical conduct were to be found to a truly
marvellous degree the right actions of a most genuine
philosophy (for—as the saying goes—“ as was his
speech, so was the manner of life’’ 2 that he displayed,
and “as his manner of life, so his speech’’), and it
was especially for this reason that, with the co-operation
of the divine power, he brought so very
to share his zeal.</p>
<p>Αnd when he saw still more pupils coming to him
(for the task of instruction had been entrusted by
Demetrius, the president of the church, to him alone),
considering that the teaching of letters3 was not
consonant with training in the divine studies, without
more ado he broke off the task of teaching letters,3
as being unprofitable and opposed to sacred study;
and then, for the good reason that he might never be
in need of others’ assistance, he disposed of all the

<p>volumes οf ancient literature which formerly he so
fondly cherished, content if he who purchased them
brought him four obols a day. For a great number
οf years he continued to live like a philosopher in
this wise, putting aside everything that might lead
to youthful lusts; all day long his discipline was to
perform labours of no light character, and the greater
part of the night he devoted himself to studying the
divine Scriptures; and he persevered, as far as
possible, in the most philosophic manner of life, at
οne time disciplining himself by fasting, at another
measuring οut the time for sleep, which he was
careful to take, never on a couch, but οn the floor.
Αnd above all he considered that those sayings οf the
Saviour in the Gospel οught to he kept which exhort
us not [to provide] two coats nor to use shoes, nor,
indeed, to be worn οut with thoughts about the
future. Yea, he was possessed οf a zeal beyond his
years, and by persevering in cold and nakedness and
going to the extremest limit οf poverty, he greatly
astounded his followers, causing grief to numbers
who besought him to share their goods, when they
saw the labour that he bestowed οn teaching divine
things. But he was not one to slacken enduranee.
Ηe is said, for example, to have walked ror many
years without using a shoe οf any description, yea
more, to have refrained for a great many years from
the use of wine and all except necessary food, so that
he actually incurred the risk of upsetting and injuring

<p>Αnd by displaying proofs such as these οf a
philosophic life to those who saw him, he naturally
stimulated a large number of his pupils to a like zeal,
so that, even among the unbelieving Gentiles and
those from the ranks of learning and philosophy,
some persons of no small account were won by his
instruction. By his ageney these very persons
received the faith of the divine Word truly in the
depths of the soul, and were conspicuous at the
persecution then taking place; insomuch that even
some οf them were arrested and perfected by
martyrdom.</p>
<p>IV. The first of these, then, was Plutarch, he whom
we mentioned a little while ago.1 As this man was
being led οn the way to death, he οf whom we have
been speaking, being present with him to the very
end of his life, was again almost killed by his fellow-
citizens, as being clearly responsible for his death.
But οn that occasion also he was kept by the will of
God.2 Αnd, after Plutarch, Serenus was the second
οf Origen's pupils to show himself a martyr, having
through fire given the proof of the faith he had
received. From the same school Heraclides was the
third martyr, and after him Ηero, the fourth; the
former of these was still a eatechumen, the latter
lately baptized. Both were beheaded. Further, in
addition to these, from the same school was proclaimed
a fifth champion of piety, one serenus, a
different person from the first-mentioned of that
name. It is recorded that after very great endurance
of torture his head was taken off. Αnd, among the
women, Ηerais, who was still under instruction for
baptism, as Οrigen himself sayssomewhere, “received
the baptism by fire,” and so ended her life.</p>

<p>v. Seventh among them must be numbered Basilides,
who led away the famous Potamiaena. The
praise οf this woman is to this day still loudly sung
by her fellow-countrymen, as of one who on
of the chastity and virginity of her body, in which
excelled, contended much with lovers (for assuredly
her body, as well as her mind, was in the full bloom
of its youthful beauty); as of one who endured much,
and at the end, after tortures that were terrible and
fearful to relate, was perfected by fire, along with her
mother Marcella. Ιt is said, in fact, that the judge,
whose name was Aquila, after inflicting severe
tortures upon her entire body, at last threatened to
hand her over to the gladiators for bodily insult, and
that, when after a brief period of reflection she was
asked what her decision was, she made a reply which
involved from their point of view something profane.
No sooner had she spoken than she received the
sentence, and Basilides, being one of those serving
in the army, took her and led her away to death.
And as the crowed tried to annoy her, and insult her
with shameful words, he kept restraining them and
driving away the insulters, displaying the greatest pity
and kindness towards her. She on her part accepted
his fellow-feeling for her and bade him be of
cheer, for that she would ask him from her Lord,
when she departed, and before long would requite
him for what he had done for her. Thus speaking
[it is said], she right nobly endured the end, boiling
pitch being poured slowly and little by little over
different parts of her body from head to toe. Such

and obtained what she requerted, and that before

brethren imparted to him the seal in the Lord, and
n the day afterwards he gave notable testimony for
the Lord and was beheaded. Αnd it is related that

<p>under Severus, whose time this present account is
describing.</p>
<p>VII. Αt this time Judas also, another writer, composed
a written discourse on the seventy weeks in the
book of Daniel; he stops his record of time at the
tenth year of the reign of Severus. Ηe also was of
the opinion that the much talked of coming of the
antichrist was then already near. So strongly did
the persecution which was then stirred up against us
disturb the minds of the many.</p>
<p>VIII. Αt that time, while Οrigen was performing
the work of instruction at Alexandria, he did a thing
which gave abundant proof of an immature and
youthful mind, yet withal of faith and self-control.
For he took the saying, “There are eunuchs which
made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s
sake,” in too literal and extreme a sense, and
both to fulfil the Saviour’s saying, and also that
might prevent all suspicion of shameful slander on
the part of unbelievers (for, young as he was, he used
to discourse on divine things with women as well as
men), he hastened to put into effect the Saviour's
Saying, taking care to escape the notice of the greater
number of his pupils. But, wishful though he might
be, it was not possible to hide a deed of this nature.
In fact Demetrius got to know of it later, since he
was presiding over the community at that place;
and while he marvelled exceedingly at him for his
rash act, he approved the zeal and the sinceriry of his
faith, bade him be of good cheer, and urged him to
attach himself now all the more to the work of
instruction.</p>

<p>Such indeed was his attitude at that time. But
not Iong afterwards, when the same person saw that
he was prospering and a great man and distinguished
and famous in the sight of all, overcome by a human
weakness, he attempted to describe the deed as
monstrous to the bishops throughout the world, when
the most highly approved and distinguished bishops
in Palestine, namely those of Caesarea and Jerusalem,1
deeming Origen worthy of privilege and the highest
honour, ordained him to the presbyterate by laying
on of hands.2 So, as he had then advanced to a position
of great esteem, and had aequired no small reputation
and fame for his virtue and wisdom in the eyes of all
men everywhere, through lack of any other ground
οf aceusation Demetrius spread grave scandal about
the deed that he had committed long ago when a boy,
and had the temerity to include in his accusations
those who raised him to the presbyterate.</p>
<p>This happened a little while afterwards. Αt that
time, however, Origen was engaged at Αlexandria in
the work or divine instruction for all, without reserve,
who came to him by night and in the course of the
day, devoting his whole time untiringly to the divine
studies and his pupils.</p>
<p>When Severus had held the principate for eighteen
years, he was succeeded by his son Antoninus.3
this time Αlexander (being one of those who Ρlayed
the man during the persecution and after contending
for the faith by their confessions were preserved by
the Providence of God), whom we have mentioned
lately4 as bishop of the church at Jerusalem,
deemed worthy of the said bishopric, distinguished

<p>IX. Many οther miracles, indeed, of Νarcissus do
e citizens of the community call to mind, as handed
wn by the brethren in succession, and among these
ey relate that the following wonder was performed
him. Once at the great all-night vigil of the
ascha it is said that the oil failed the deacons, and
at when deep despondency seized the whole
ultitude, thereupon Narcissus commanded those
ho were preparing the lights to draw water and
ring it to him; that when this was no sooner said
an done, he then prayed οver the water, and bade
em pour it down into the lamps with unfeigned
ith in the Lord. Αnd that when they did this,
contrary to all reason by miraculous and divine power
nature was changed in quality from water into
il; and that for a very long time, from that day even
ours, a little was preserved as a οf that wonder
former days by very many οf the brethren there.</p>
<p>Αnd they enumerate a great many other things
about the life of this man worthy of mention, among
which is the following. Certain miserable creatures,
not being able to endure his energy and the firmness
of his conduct, and fearing lest they should be taken
and put on their trial (for they were conscious of many
evil deeds), anticipated the event by devising an
intrigue agrinst him and spreading a certain grave
slander to his hurt. Then, with a view to securing
the belief οf their hearers, they strove to confirm their
accusations by oaths; one swore, “[if this is not true]
ay I be destroyed by fire”; another, “may
y be wasted by an untoward diseasse”; and

ey might, none of the faithful gave heed to them,
the the fame of Narcissus's sobriety and virtuous
nner of life was always well known to all. Ηe,
vertheless, could not brook the wickedness of what
been said, and, besides, had for a long time been
uing the philosophic life,; so he escaped the
οle company of the church, and spent many years
cretly in deserts and obscure parts οf the country.
et the great eye of Justice did not remain quiet at

In his day Narcissus appeared from somewhere, as if

appeared to him in a vision at night. Whereupon,
as if in obedience to some oraele, he made the journey
rom the land of the Cappadocians, where he was
rst deemed worthy of the episeopate, to Jerusalem,
for the purpose of prayer and investigation οf the
sacred] places. The people there gave him the most
ordial welcome, and suffered him not to return home

as seen by them also at night, and which vouchsafed
n identieal utterance of the clearest kind to those
f them who were peculiarly zealous. For it indieated
o them to go forth outside the gates and welcome as
heir bishop him who was fore-ordained of God. Αnd
oing this, with the common consent of the bishops
ho were administering the churches round about,
hey compelled him of necessity to remain. Αnd in
fact Alexander himself in a personal letter to the
ntinoites,2 which is still to this day preserved

bear their names we reject, as men of experience,
knowing that such were not handed down to us. For
I myself, when I eame among you, imagined that all
οf you clung to the true faith; and, without going
through the Gospel put forward by them in the name
f Peter, I said: If this is the only thing that
seemingly causes captious feelings among you, let
it be read. But since I have now learnt, from what
has been told me, that their mind was lurking in
some hole οf hersey,2 I shall give diligence to come

<p>Νow in the Stromateis he has composed a patchwork,
not only of the divine Scripture, but of the
writings of the Greeks as well, if he thought that
they also had said anything useful, and he mentions
opinions from many sources, explaining Greek and
barbarian alike, and moreover sifts the false opinions
οf the heresiarchs; and unfolding much history he
gives us a work of great erudition. With all these
he mingles also the opinions of philosophers, and so
he has suitably made the title of the Stromateis to
correspond to the work itself. Αnd in them he has
also made use of testimonies from the disputed
writings, the known known as the Wisdom of Solomon,
and the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of sirach, and the
Epistle to the Hebrews, and those of Barnabas, and
Clement, and Jude; and he mentions Tatian's book
Against the Greeks, and Cassian, sinee he also had
composed a chronography,1 and moreover Philo and
Aristobulus and Josephus and Demetrius and
Eupolemus, Jewish writers, in that they would show,
all of them, in writing, that Moses and the Jewish
race went back further in their origins than the
Greeks.2 Αnd the books of Clement, of which we
are speaking, are full of much other useful learning.

himself that he came very near to the successors of
the Αpostles3; and he promises in them also to

οf olden time, for the benefit or those that should
come after; and he mentions in it Melito and
Irenaeus and some others, Whose accounts also of the
matter he has set down.</p>
<p>XIV. Αnd in the Hypotyposeis, to speak briefly,
he has given concise explanations of all the Canonical
scriptures, not passing over even the disputed writings,
Ι mean the Epistle of Jude and the remaining
Catholic Εpistles, and the Epistle of Barnabas,
the Apocalypse known as Peter's. Αnd as for
Εpistle to the Hebrews, he says indeed that it is
Paul's, but that it was written for Hebrews in the
Ηebrew tongue, and that Luke, having carefully
translated it, published it for the Greeks; hence,
as a result of this translation, the same complexion
of style is found in this Epistle and in the Acts: but
that the [words] “Paul an apostle” were
not prefixed. For, says he, “in writing to Ηebrews
who had conceived a prejudice against him and were
suspicious of him, he very wisely did not repel them
at the beginning by putting his name.”</p>
<p>Then lower down he adds: “But now, as the
blessed elder used to say, since the Lord, being the
apostle of the Αlmighty, was sent to the Hebrews,
ΡauΙ, through modesty, since he had been sent to
the Gentiles, does not inscribe himself as an apostle
οf the Hebrews, both to give due deference to the
Lord and because he wrote to the Ηebrews also out
of his abundance, being a preacher and apostle of the
Gentiles.”</p>

a tradition of the primitive elders with regard to the
οrder οf the Gospels, as follows. Ηe Said that those

Gospels were first written which include the genealogies,
but that the Gospel according to Mark came
into being in this manner1: When Ρeter had
preached the word at Rome, and by the Spirit
Ρroclaimed the Gospel, that those present, who were
many, exhorted Mark, as one who had followed him
for a long time and remembered what had been
spoken, to make a record of what was said; and
that he did this, and distributed the Gospel among
those that asked him. Αnd that when the matter
came to Ρeter’s knowledge he neither strongly forbade
it nor urged it forward. But that John, last
οf all, conscious that the outward2 facts had been
forth in the Gospels, was urged οn by his disciples,
and, divinely moved by the Spirit, composed a
spiritual Gospel. This is Clement's account.</p>
<p>Αnd again Αlexander, of whom we spoke before,3
mentions Clement, and at the same time also Pantaenus,
in a certain letter to Origen, as men who
had been known to him. Ηe writes as follows: “For
this also has proved to be the will of God, as thou
knowest, that the friendship that comes to us from
οur forefathers should remain unshaken, nay rather
grow warmer and more stedfast. For we know as
fathers those blessed ones who went before us, with
whom we shall be ere long: Pantaenus, truly blessed
and my master, and the holy Clement, who was my
master and profited me, and all others like them.
Through these I came to know thee, who art the
best in all things, and my master and brother.”

of the Romans, himself states in writing somewhere
that he stayed at Rome. Ηis words are: “Desiring
to see the most ancient church of the Romans.”</p>
<p>Αfter spending a short time there, he returned to
Αlexandria, and indeed continued to fulfil in that city
his customary work οf instruction with all Ζeal,
Demetrius, the bishop of the people there, still
exhorting and wellnigh entreating him to ply
diligently his task of usefulness for the brethren.
XV. But when he saw that he was becoming unable
for the deeper study of diving things, namely, the
examination and translation of the sacred writings,
and in addition for the instruction of those who were
coming to him and did not give him time to breathe
(for one batch of pupils after another kept frequenting
from morn to night his lecture-room), he made a
division of the numbers. seleeting Heraclas from
among his pupils, a man who was Ζealous of divine
things, and, as well, a very learned person and no
tyro in philosophy, he gave him a share in the task
of instruction, assigning to him the preliminary studies
οf those who were just learning their elements, and
reserving for himself the teaching of the experienced
pupils.</p>
<p>XVI. Αnd so accurate was the examination that
Origen brought to bear upon the divine books, that
he even made a thorough study of the Ηebrew tongue,

Nicopolis, near Αetium, and the other in such another

strongly maintain that the law ought to be kept in a

views of the heresy of Valentinus,1 was refuted
truth as presented by Origen, and, as if his mind were
illuminated by light, gave his adhesion to the true
doctrine as taught by the Church. And many other
cultured persons, since Origen's fame was noised
abroad everywhere, came to him to make trial οf the
man's sufficiency in the sacred books. Αnd numbers
of the heretics, and not a few of the most distinguished
philosophers, gave earnest heed to him, and, one
might almost say, were instructed by him in secular
philosophy as well as in divine things. For he used
to introduce also to the study of philosophy as many
as he saw were naturally gifted, imparting geometry
and arithmetic and the οther preliminary subjects,
and then leading them on to the systems which are
found among philosophers, giving a detailed account
of their treatises commenting upon and examining
into each, so that the man was proclaimed as a great
philosopher even among the Greeks themselves. Αnd
many persons also of a more ignorant character he
urged to take up the ordinary elementary studies,
declaring that they would derive no small advantage
from these when they came to examine and study
the drvine Scriptures. For this reason he deemed
especially necessary even for himself a training in
secular and philosophic studies.</p>

this direction, we have the Greek philosophers themselves

we find frequent mention οf the man. sometimes
they would dedicate their books to him, sometimes
submit their οwn labours to him for judgement, as
to a master. But why need one say this, when even
Porphry,1 who settled in our day in Sicily,
treatises against us, attempting in them to slander
the sacred Scriptures, and mentioned those who had
given their interpretations of them? Αnd since he
could not by any means bring any base charge against
our opinions, for lack of argument he turned to deride
and slander their interpreters also, and among these
origen especially. Ηe says that in his early manhood
he had known him; and he tries to slander the man,
but unknown to himself really commends him, telling
the truth in some cases, where he could not speak
otherwise, in οthers telling lies, where he thought he
could escape detection; and at one time accusing
him as a Christian, at another describing his devotion
to the study οf philosophy.</p>
<p>But hear the very words that he uses: “Some, in
their eagerness to find an explanation of the wickedness
of the Jewish writings rather than give them up,
had recourse to interpretations that are incompatible
and do not harmonize with what has been
offering not so much a defence of what was outlandish
as commendation and praise of their own work. For
they boast that the things said plainly by Moses
are riddles, treating them as divine oracles full of
hidden mysteries, and bewitching the mental judgement
by their own pretentious obscurity; and so
they put forward their interpretations.”</p>

kind οf absurdity must be traced to a man whom I
met when I was still quite young, who had a great
reputation, and still holds it, because of the writings
he has left behind him, I mean Oregen, whose fame
has been widespread among the teachers of this kind
of learning. For this man was a hearer of Ammonius,1
who had the greatest proficiency in philosophy in our
day; and so far as a grasp οf knowledge was concerned
he owed much to his master, but as regards
the right choice in life he took the opposite road to
him. For Αnnnonius was a Christian, brought up in
Christian doctrine by his parents, yet, when he began
to think and study philosophy, he immediately
changed his way οf life conformably to the laws; but
Origen, a Greek educated in Greek learning, drove
headlong towards barbarian recklessness; and making
straight for this he hawked himself and his literary
skill about; and while his manner of life was christian
and contrary to the law, in his opinions about material
things and the Deity he played the Greek, and
introduced Greek ideas into foreign fables. For he
was always consorting with Ρlatο, and was conversant
with the writings οf Numenius and Cronius, Apollophanes
and Longinus and Moderatus, Nicomachus
and the distinguished men among the Pythagoreans;
and he used also the books of Chaeremon the Stoic
and Cornutus, from whom he learnt the fingurative
interpretation, as employed in the Greek mysteries,
and applied it to the Jewish writings.”</p>

third treatise of his writings against Christians. Αnd

erudition, he cleariy lies (for what is the opponent
of Christians not prepared to do ?) where he says
that Origen came over from the Greeks, and that
Ammonius lapsed from a godly life into paganism.
For Οrigen kept safely the Christian teaching
which he had from his parents, as the hitory above
made clear1; and Ammonius maintained his inspired
philosophy pure and unshaken right up to the very
end of his life.2 To this fact the man's works witness
to the present day, and the widespread fame that
he owes to the writings he left behind him, as, for
example, that entitled on the Harmony of Moses
and Jesus, and all the other works that are to be
found in the possession of lovers of literature.</p>
<p>Let these things be stated to prove at once the
false one's calumny and Origen's great knowledge
of Greek learning. With regard to such learning
also he writes as follows in a certain epistle, defending
himself against those who found fault with him for
his zeal in that direction: “But as Ι was devoted to
the word, and the fame of οur proficiency was spreading
abroad, there approached me sometimes heretics,
sometimes those conversant with Greek learning, and
especially philosophy, and I thought it right to
examine both the opinions of the heretics, and also
the elaim that the philosophers make to speak
concerning truth. Αnd in doing this we followed the
example of Pantaenus, who, before us, was of assistance
to many, and had acquired no small attainments
in these matters, and also Heraclas, who now has a
seat in the presbytery of the Alexandrians, whom Ι

say what is evidently not true. For instance, where
ere are found persons suited to help the brethren,
ey also are invited to preach to the people by the
οly bishops, as, for example, in Laranda Εuelpis by
eon, and in Iconium Paulinus by Celsus, and in
ynnada Theodore by Αttieus, our brother
ishops. Αnd it is likely that this thing happens in
ther places also without οur knowing it. ”</p>
<p>In this way honour was paid to the man of whom
we are speaking, while he was still young, not only
y his fellow-countrymen but also by the bishops
in a foreign land. But since Demetrius once again
ecalled him by letter, and by men who were deacons
f the Church urged him to come back with speed
Alexandria, he retumed and continued to labour
ith his accustomed zeal.</p>

earned churchemen, and the letters which they
enned to οne another are still extant and easily
ccessible. They have been preserved even to our
ay in the library at Aelia,1 equipped by Alexander,
en ruling the church there ; from which also we
have been able ourselves to gather together the
aterial for our present work.</p>

etters, varied and beautiful compositions. Ηe was

curbing the recklessness and audacity of his
opponents in composing new Scriptures, he mentions

the bishop of the Romans, 4 departed this life,
having held the ministry for eighteen entire years.</p>
<p>After him Callistus was entrusted with the episcopate;
he survived five years and then left the
ministry to Urban.
Αfter this the Εmperor Αlexander suceeeded to
the principate of the Romans, Αntoninus having
continued in office for only four years. Αt this time
also Ρhiletus succeeded Asclepiades in the church

<p>Such was the state of affairs when Pontianus succeeded
Urban, who had been bishop of the chureh of
the Romans for eight years, and Ζebennus came after
Ρhiletus as [bishop] of the [church] of the Antiochenes.
In their day Οrigen journeyed to Greece through
Palestine because of an urgent necessity in Chureh
matters, and reveived the laying-on of hands for the
presbyterate at Caesarea from the bishops there.
The agitation that was set on foot concerning him on
this aeeount, and the decistions made by those who
presided over the chuiehes on the matters agitated,
as well as the other contributions that he made as he
was reaching his prime to the study of the divine
Word, require a separate composition, and we have
given a fairly full account of them in the seeond
[book] of the Apology that we have written on his
behalf.</p>
<p>XXIV. But to that information it is necessary to
add that in the sixth of his Expositions οn the
[Gospel] according to John he indicates that he composed
the first five while he was still at Alexandria ;
but of this work on the whole of the selfsame Gospel
only twenty-two tomes have come our way. Αnd
[We must also state] that in the ninth of those On
Genesis (there are twelve in all) he shows that not
only were those before the ninth written at Alexandria,
but also [his commentary] on the first twentyfive
Psalms, and, as well those on Lamentations, of
which there have come to us five tomes. In these he
mentions also those Οn the Resurrection, of which
there are two. Moreover he wrote his De Principiis
before his removal from Alexandria, and he composed
the [books] entitled Stromateis, ten in number, in
the same city in the reign of Alexaner, as is shown

<p>These things he inserts in the above-mentioned
treatise. But in the first of his [Commentaries] on
the Gospel according to Mattheru defending the canon
of the Church, he gives his testimony that he knowns
only four Gospels, writing somewhat as follows:
“. . . as having learnt by tradition concerning
four Gospels, which alone are unquestionable in the
Church of God under heaven, that first was written
that according to Matthew, who was once a taxcollector
but afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ,
who published it for those who from Judaism came to
believe, composed as it was in the Hebrew language.
secondly, that according to Mark, who wrote it in
accordance with Peter's instructions, whom also Ρeter
aeknowledged as his son in the catholic epistle,
speaking in these terms : ‘She that is in Babylon,
elect together with you, saluteth you ; and so doth
Μark my son.᾿ Αnd thirdly, that according to
who wrote, for those who from the Gentiles [came to
believe], the Gospel that was praised by Ρaul. Αfter
them all, that according to John.”</p>
<p>Αnd in the fifth of his Expositions οn the Gospel
according to John the same person says this with
reference to the epistles of the apostles : “But he
who was made suffieient to become a minister of the
new covenant, not of the letter but of the spirit, even
Ρaul, who fully preached the Gospel from Jerusalem
and round about even unto Illyricum, did not so
much as write to all the Churches that he taught ;
and even to those to which he wrote he sent but a few

lines. Αnd Ρeter, on whom the Church of Christ is
built, against which the gates of Ηades shall not
prevail, has left one acknowledged epistle, and, it
may be, a second also ; for it is doubted. Why need
I speak of him who leaned back on Jesus᾿
John, who has left behind one Gospel, confessing that
he could write so many that even the world itself
could not contain them ; and he wrote also the
Apocalypse, being ordered to keep silence and not
to write the voices of seven thunders ?. Ηe has left
also an epistle of a very few lines, and, it may be, a
second and a third ; for not all say that these are
genuine. Οnly, the two of them together are not a
hundred lines long.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, he thus discusses the Εpistle to the
Ηebrews, in his Homilies upon it : “That the charaeter
of the dietion of the epistle entitled To the Ηebrews
has not the ’s rudeness in speech, who confessed
himself rude in speech, that is, in style, but
that the epistle is better Greek in the framing of its
dietion, will be admitted by everyone who is able to
discern differences of style. But again, on the other
hand, that the thoughts of the epistle are admirable,
and not inferior to the acknowledged writings of the
apostle, to this also everyone will consent as true who
has given attention to reading the apostle.”</p>
<p>Further on, he adds the following remarks : “But
as for myself, if I were to state my own opinion, I
should say that the thoughts are the apostle's
that the style and composition belong to one who
called to mind the apostle's teachings and, as, it

Emperor of the Romans had brought his principate to
an end after thirteen years, he was suceeeded by
Maximin Caesar.1 Ηe, through ill-will towards the
house of Alexander, since it consisted for the most
part of beievers, raised a persecution, ordering the
leaders of the Church alone to be put to death, as
being responsible for the teaching of the Gospel.
nen aho Origen composed his work On Martyrdom,
dedicating the treatise to Ambrose and Protoctetus, a
presbyter of the commurity at Caesarea ; for in the
persecution no ordinary distress had befallen them
both, in which distress it is recorded that these men
were distinguished for the confession they made
during the period, not more than three years, that
the reign of Maximin lasted. Origen has noted this
particular time for the persecution, in the twentysecond
of his Expositions of the Gospel according to
John, and in various letters.</p>
<p>XXIX. Gordian having succeeded to the Roman
government after Maximin,2 Pontianus, when he had
been bishop of the church of Rome for six years, was
succeeded by Anteros; who exercised his ministry
for a month, and was succeeded by Fabian. It is
said that Fabian, after the death οf Αnteros, came
from the country along with others and stayed at
Rome, where he came to the office in a most miraculous
manner, thanks to the divine and heavenly grace.
For when the brethren were all assembled for the
purpose of appointing him who should succeed to the
episcopate, and very many notable and distinguished
ersons were in the thoughts of many, Fabian, who
as there, came into nobody's mind. But all of

saviour ; whereupon the whole people, as if moved
by one divine inspiration, with all eagerness and with

took him and placed him on the episcopal throne.</p>
<p>Αt that very time also Ζebennus, bishop of Antioch,
departed this life and Babylas succeeded to the rule ;

tasks at Caesarea, many came to him, not only of
the natives, but also numbers of foreign pupils who
had left their own countries. Αmong these as
especially distinguished we know to have been
Theodore, who was the selfsame person as that
renowned bishop in our day, Gregory, and his brother
Αthenodore. Both of them were strongly enamoured
of Greek and Roman Studies, but Origen instilled into
them a passion for philosophy and urged them to
exchange their former love for the study of divine
truth.1 Five whole years they continued with him,
and made such progress in divine things that while
still young both of them were deemed worthy of
the episcopate in the churehes of Pontus.</p>

Daniel were a spurious forgery. Origen makes a
very full reply to it. Αnd of the same Africanus
there have reached us as well five books οf Chronographies,
a monument of labour and accuracy. In
these he says that he himself made a journey to
Alexandria because οf the great fame of Ηeraclas ;
who, as we have stated,1 was greatly distinguished
for philosophy and other Greek learning, and was
entrusted with the bishopric of the church there.
Αnd another letter of the same Αfricanus is extant,
to Αristides, On the supposed discord between the
Genealogies of Christ in Matthew and Luke. In it
he establishes very clearly the harmony οf the evangelists
from an account that came down to him, which
by anticipation I set forth in the proper place in the
first book of the present work.2</p>
<p>XXXII. Αnd Origen too at this time was composing
his Commentaries οn Isaiah, and at the same time
those also οn Ezekiel. Of the former, thirty tomes
have come our way on the third part of Ιsaiah, up to
the vision of the beasts in the desert ; and on Ezekiel
five and twenty, the only ones that he has written
οn the whole prophet. Αnd having come at that
time to Αthens, he finished the commentary on
Ezekiel, and began that on the song of Songs,
carrying it forward there up to the fifth book. And
returning to Caesarea he brought these also to an
end, numbering ten. Why should one draw up the
exact catalogue of the man's works here and

we did record it in our account of the life of Pamphilus,
that holy martyr of our day, in which, in showing
the extent οf Pamphilus’s zeal for divine things,
quoted as evidence the lists in the library that
had brought together of the works of Origen and of
other ecclesiastical writers; writers ; and from
who pleases can gather the fullest knowledge of the
works of Origen that have reached us. But We must
now proceed with οur history.</p>
<p>XXXIII. Beryllus, who, as we have mentioned a
little above,1 was bishop of Bostra in Αrabia, perverting
the Church’s standard, attempted to introduce
things foreign to the faith, daring to say that
our Saviour and Lord did not pre-exist in an individual
existence of Ηis own before Ηis coming to reside
among men, nor had Ηe a divinity of Ηis own,
only the Father’s dwelling in Ηim.
after a large number of bishops had held questionings
and discussions with the man, Origen being invited
along with others, entered in the first place into
conversation with the man to discover what Were his
opinions, and when he knew what it was that he
asserted, he corrected what was unorthodox, and,
persuading him by reasoning, established him in the
truth as to the doctrine, and restored him to his
former sound opinion. Αnd there are still extant
to this very day records in writing both of Beryllus
and of the synod that was held on his account, which
contain at once the questions Οrigen put put him and
the discussions that took place in his own community,
and all that was done on that occasion. And a great
many other things about Origen have been handed
down to memory by the older men of our day, which

I think it well to pass over, as they do not concern
the Ρresent work. But all that it was necessary to
know of his affairs, these also one may gather from
the Apology that was written on his behalf by us
and Ρamphilus, that holy martyr Of our day, a work
that we were at pains to compose conjointly because
of the fault-finders.</p>
<p>XXXXIV. When after six whole years Gordian
broadught his government of the Romans to an end,
Ρhilip along with his sOn Ρhilip suceeeded to the
principate.1 It is recorded that he, being a Christian,
wished on the day of the last paschal vigil to share
along with the multitude the Ρrayers at the church,
but was not permitted to enter by him who was then
preriding until he eonfessed and numbered himself
among those who were reckoned to be in sins and
were occupying the place of penitence; for that
otherwise, had he not done so, he would never have
been received by [the president] on account of the
many charges made concerning him. Αnd it is said
that he obeyed readily, displaying by his actions how
genuine and pious was his disposition towards the
fear of God.</p>
<p>XXXV. It was the third year of his regin 2 when
Ηeraclas departed this life, after Ρresiding for sixteen
years over the churches at Αlexandria; Dionysius
took up the episcopal office.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Then indeed, as was fitting, When the
faith was inereasing and our doctrine was boldly
proclaimed in the ears of all, it is said that Οrigen,
who was over sixty years Οf age, inasmuch as he had
now acquired immeense facility from long preparation,3

<p>Αt that time also he composed the treatises, eight
in number, in answer to the work against us, entitled
True Discourse of Celsus the Epicurean. and
twenty-five tomes on the Gospel according to
Μatthew, and those on the twelve prophets, of which
we found only five and twenty. Αnd there is extant
alSo a letter of his to the Emperor Philip himself,
and another to his wife Severa, and narious other
letters to various persons. Αs many of these as we
have been able to bring together, preserved as they
were here and there by various persons, we arranged
in separate roll-eases, so that they might no longer
be dispersed. These letters number more than a
hundred. Αnd he wrote also to Fabian the bishop
of Rome, and to very many other rulers of churches,
with reference to his orthodoxy. You will find these
facts also established in the sixth book of the Apology

human soul dies for a while in this present time, along
with our bodies, at their death, and with them turns
to corruption; but that hereafter, at the time of the
resurrection, it will come to life again along with
them. Moreover, when a synod of no small dimensions
was then assembled together, Origen was again
invited, and there opened a discussion in public on
the subject in question, with sueh power that he
changed the opinions of those who had formerly been
deluded.</p>

opinion had its beginning, the heresy known as that
οf the Helkesaites, whic no sooner began than it was
quenched. Origen mentions it in a public address οn
the eighty-second Psalm, some such words as these:
“There has come just now a certain man who prides
himself on being able to champion a godless and very
impious οpinion, of the Helkesaites, as it is ealled,
which has lately come into opposition with the
churches. I shall lay before you the mischievous
teachings ofthat opinion, that you may not be carried
away by it. It rejects some things from every
scripture; agam; it has made use texts from every
part ofthe old Testament and the Gospels; rejects
the Αpostle entirely. Αnd it says that to deny is a
matter of of indifference, and that the ffisereet man will
on occasions of necessity deny with his mouth, but
not in his heart. Αnd they produee a certain book
οf which they say that it has fallen from heaven, and
that he who has heard it and beldieves will reeeive
forgiveness οf his sins — a forgiveness other than that
which Christ Jesus has bestowed.”</p>

for seven years he was succeeded by Decius. 1 Ηe, on
account of his enmity towards Philip, raised a persecution
against the churches, in which Fabian was
pertected by martyrdom at Rome, and was sueceeded
in the episeopate by Cornelius.</p>
<p>In Palestine, Αlexander, the bishop of the church of
Jerusalem, appeared οnce more for Chrisrt’s sake

second time distinguished himself by the confession
he made; he underwent the trial of imprisonment,
crowned with the venerable hoary loeks of ripe old
age. Αnd when after the splenffid and manifest

us, blrt it preceded it by a whole year; and that
prophet and creator οf evils for this eity, whoever he
was, was beforehand in stirring and inciting the masses
οf the heathen against us, fanning anew the flame of
their native superstition. Aroused by him and seizing
upon all authority for their unholy deeds, they conceived
that this kind of worship of their gods—the
thirsting for οur blood—was the only form of piety.</p>
<p>“First, then, they seized an old man named Metras,
and bade him utter blasphemous words; and when
le refused to οbey they belaboured his body with
udgels, stabbed his face and eyes with sharp reeds,
and leading him to the suburbs stoned him.</p>
<p>“Then they led a woman called Quinta, a believer,
the idol temple, and were for forcing her to
worship. But when she turned away and showed her
lisgust, they bound her by the feet and dragged her
through the whole city over the rough pavement,
hat she was bruised by the big stones, beating her
ll the while; and bringing her to the same place
hey stoned her to death. Then with one accord they
II rushed to the houses of the godly, and, falling
ach upon those whom they recognized as neighbours,
hey harried, spoiled and plundered them, appropriting
the more valuable of their treasures, and scatterng
and burning in the streets the cheaper articles and
uch as were made of wood, until they gave the city
he appearance of having been captured by enemies.
ut the brethren gave way and gradually retired,
and, like those of whom Paul also testified, they took
yfully the spoiling of their possessions. Αnd I

single one who fell into their —who up to the

acting as the hired steward of one of the rulers. Ηis

those who wandered in deserts and mountains,1

fled to the Αrabian mountain with his wife, 2 and
never returned, nor could the brethren ever lay eyes

His kingdom, and take part in Ηis decisions and judge

of the fallen brethren who became answerable for
the charge of ; and seeing their conversion
and repentance, they judged it had the power to
prove acceptable to Ηim who hath no pleasure at all
in the death of the sinner, but rather his repentance ;
and so they received and admitted them to the
worship οf the Church 1 as consistentes, 2 and gave
them fellowship in their prayers and feasts. What
then do ye counsel us, brethren, on these matters ?
What are we to do ? Αre we to be of like opinion
and mind with them, uphold their decision and concession,
and deal kindly with those they pitied ? Or
shall we esteem their decision unjust, and set ourselves
up as critics of their opinion, cause grief to
kindness, and do away with their arrangement ? ’’</p>
<p>Νow these words Dionysius added suitably, raising
the question about those who had proved weak in
the time of persecution, XLIII. since Novatus, 3 a
presbyter of the church of the Romans, being lifted
up by arrogance against these, as if there was no
longer any hope of salvation for them, not even if
they were to perform everything that a genuine
conversion and a pure confession demand, became
the leader of a separate sect of those who, in their
pride of mind, styled themselves Ρuritans. Whereupon
a very large synod was assembled at Rome, of
sixty bishop and a still greater number οf presbyters
οf penitents. They were admitted to the eucharistic prayers,
but debarred from communion.
<note type="footnote">3 This person, the founder of the Novatianist sect, is called
by Eusebius, and subsequent Greek writers, Novatus, but by
the Westerns (no doubt rightly) Novatianus. Cf. the letters
οf Dionysius in c. 45 and vii. 8</note>

pastors in their several regions individually considered
the question as to what was to be done. It
was unanimously decreed that Νovatus, together
with the partners of his arrogance, and those who
decided to agree with the man's brother-hating and
most inhuman opinion, should be considered as
strangers to the Church, but that such of the
brethren as had fallen into the misfortune should be
treated and and restored with the medicines of repentance.</p>
<p>Νow there have reached us a letter of Cornelius,
bishop of the Romans, to Fabius, bishop of the church
of the Αntiochenes, telling the fects concerning the
Roman Synod, and what was decreed by them of
Italy and Africa and the regions thereabout; ; and,
again, another of Cyprian and of those with him in
Αfrica, composed in the Latin language, in which it
was made clear that they also agreed that those who
had suffered trial should meet with succour, and that
in the reason of things it was fitting that the leader
of the heresy should be excommunicated from the
Catholic Church, and likewise all those who were
led away with him. To these was subjoine3d a certain
οther letter of Cornelius, on the resolutions of the
synod ; and, again, another on the doings of Novatus.
There is nothing to prevent me from quoting parts
of this last, so that those who read this book may
know about him. Ιn explaining, then, to Fabius
what kind of manner of man Novatus was, Cornelius
writes these very words : “ “But that you may know
that for a long time back this marvellous fellow has
been seeking the office of a bishop, and has succeeded
in concealing in his heart this his violent desire, using

who had renounced their own salvation, that
he might send them to a small and very insignificant
part of Italy, and entice thence by some made-up
device three bishops, rough and very simple men.
Ηe confidently maintained and affirmed the necessity
of their coming quickly to Rome, on the pretext that
any dissension whatsoever that had arisen might be
ended by their activity as mediators, conjointly with
other bishops. When they arrived, inasmuch as
they were too simple, as we said before, for the unscrupulous
devices of the wicked, they were shut up
by certain disorderly men like himself, and at the
tenth hour, when they were drunk, and sick with the
after effects, he forcibly compelled them to give him a
bishop's office by a counterfeit and vain laying on of
hands, an office that he assumed by crafty treachery
since it did not fall to his lot. Οne of the bishops not
long afterwards returned to the Church, bewailing
and confessing his fault ; with whom we had communion
as a layman, all the laity Ρresent interceding
for him. And as for the remaining bishops, to these
we appointed successors, whom we sent into the
places where they were.</p>

Master. But not even did this great multitude, so

necessary in the Church, that number who by God's
providence were rich and multiplying, nor an immense
and countless laity, turn him from such a desperate
failure and recall him to the Church.”
Αnd again, further on, he adds to these remarks
as follows : “ But come, let us next say in what deeds
οr in what kind of conduct he placed his confidence
so as to aspire to the episcopate. Was it because
from the beginning he had been brought up in the
Church, and had fought many conflicts on her behalf,
and had been through the midst of dangers, many
and great, for the sake of religiojn ? Νot so. The
occasion of his acceptance of the faith was Satan, who
resorted to him and dwelt in him for a long time.
While he was being healed by the exorcists he fell
into a grievous sickness, and, as he was considered
to be all but dead, received baptism by affusion on
the very bed in which he lay, if indeed one may say
that such a man has received it. Νor yet indeed did
he obtain the other things, when he recovered from
his sickness, of which one should partake according
to the rule of the Church, or the sealing by the bishop.
Αnd as he did not obtain these, how could he obtain
the Ηoly spirit ? ’’</p>
<p>Αnd shortly afterwards he says again : “ . . . he
who through cowardice and love of life at the time of
persecution denied that he was a presbyter. For
when he was requested and exhorted by the deacons
to leave the cell in which he shut himself, and bring
all the help to the brethren that it is right and
possible for a presbyter to being to brethren who are
in danger and in need of succour, so far was he from
obeying the deacons' exhortations, that he even went

no longer wished to be a presbyter, since he was
enamoured of a different philosophy.”</p>
<p>Passing over a few things, he again adds as follows :
“ For when this illustrious person deserted the
Church of God, in which, when he came to believe, he
was deemed worthy of the presbyterate through the
favour of the bishop, who laid his hand on him to
confer that order (meeting the opposition of all the
clergy and many lay persons as well—since one
has received baptism by affusion1 on his bed owing
to sickness, as Νovatus had, might not be ordained to
an order—with the request that he should be
to ordain this man alone) .... ”</p>
<p>Then he adds something else, the worst of all the
man's offences, saying thus : “ For when he has
the offerings, and is distributing to each his portion,2
as he gives it [into their hands] he compels the
wretched persons to utter an oath instead of the
blessing, taking in both his hands those of him who
had received, and not letting go until they swear
saying thus (for I shall use his very words) : ‘Swear
to me by the Blood and Body of our Lord Jesus Christ
never to forsake me and turn to Cornelius.’
the miserable person does not taste until he first
calls down a curse upon himself, and instead οf saying
the Αmen as he receives that bread, he says, ‘ I will
not return to Cornelius.’</p>
<p>Αnd after οther remarks he again says as follows :

<p>XLIV. But to this same Fabius, when he was
inclining somewhat towards the schism, Dionysius
also, he of Alexandria, wrote, making many οther reamarks
with reference to repentance in his letter to
him and describing the conflicts of those lately
martyred at Alexandria. In the course of his narrative
he tells a certain astonishing tale, which must
needs be handed down in this work. It is as follows :
‘‘ But this one example that happened amongst us
I shall set forth for thee. There was a certain
Serapion amongst us, an old man and a believer,
who lived blamelessly for a long time, but in the trial
fell. This man oftentimes besought [absolution], and
no one paid him heed. For indeed he had sacrificed.
Αnd, falling sick, he continued for three successive
days speechless and unconscious ; but on the fourth

said: ‘Ηow long, my child, do ye hold me back?
Ηaste ye, I pray, and grant me a speedy release;
do thou summon me one or the presbyters.’
having Said this he again became speechless. The
boy ran for the presbyter. But it was night, and he
was unwell and eould not come. Yet sicne I had
given an order that those who Were departing this

us see the kind of lerter that the same person wrote
also to Novatus, 2 who was then disturbing the Roman
brotherhood. Since, then, he put forward some of the
brethren as an excuse for his defection and sehism,

to Novatianus 1 a brother, greeting. If thou wast led
οn unwillingly, as thou sayest, thou wilt prove it by
retiring willingly. For a man ought to suffer anything
and everything rather than divide the Church of Good,
and it were not less glorious to incur martyrdom to
avoid schism than to avoid idolatry, nay, in my opinion
it were more so. For in the οne case a man is a
martyr for the sake of his own single soul, but in the
other for the sake οf the whole Church. And if thou
wert even now to persuade or compel the brethren
to come to one mind, thy recovery will be greater
than. thy fall, and the one will not be reckoned, while
the οther will be praised. But if they obey thee not,
and thou hast no power, by all means save thine own
soul. I pray that thou mayest fare well and cleave
to peace in the Lord.”</p>

less than two years, he was forthwith murdered along
with his sons, and Gallus sueeeeded him. 2 Αt this
time 3 Origen died, having completed the
year save one of his life. Νow when writing to
Hermammon, Dionysius speaks as follows, with
reference to Gallus: “But not even did Gallus recognize
the fault [in the policy] of Decius, nor yet ffid he
look to that which caused his fall, but he stumbled
against the same stone that was before his eyes.
For when his reign was prospering, and matters were
moing accorffing to his mind, he drove away the holy
men who were supplicating God for his peaee and
health. Therefore along with them he banished
-ho their prayers on his behalf.”</p>

episeopate to an end after about three years, Lucius
was appointed his suecessor ; but he exercised his
ministry for less than eight entire months, and dying
transmitted ffihls offiee to stephen. To him Dionysius
inffited the Rrst of his letters On Baptism, no small
question harivlng then arisen as to whether it Were
neeessary to eleanse by means of baptism those who
were turning from any heresy whatsoever. Α euStom,
which was at any rate old, having prevailed in such
cases to use only prayer with the laying οn of hands,
III. Cyprian, pastor of the community at Carthage,
was the Rrst of thoSe of his day to consider that they
οught not to be admitted otherwise than by having
been first eleansed from their error by baptism. But
stephen, thinking that they ought not to make any
innovation contrary to the traffition that had prevailed
from the beginning, was full of indignation
thereat. Iv. Dionysius, therefore, haring communi-
cated with him on this point at very great length
in a letter, at its close shows that with the abatement
οf the persecution the churches everywhere,
having now rejected the innovation of Novatus, had
resumed peace among themselves. Ηe writes thus:
V. “ But know now, brother, that all the ehurches in
the East and still further away, which were fonnerly
divided, have been united, and all their presidents
eveqwhere are of like mind, rejoicing above measure
at the unexpeeted arrival of peaee: Demetrian at
Αntiοch, Theoctistus at Caesarea, Mazabanes at

For I name only the more eminent dishops, to avoid
making my letter long and my discourse teffious.
Νevertheless, the syrias as a whole and Αrabia,
which ye constantly help and to which ye have now
written, and Mesopotamia and Ρontus and
and, in a everywhere all everywhere rejoice exceedingly
their concord and brotherly love, giving glory to
God.”</p>
<p>such is the aceount of Dionysius. But when
stephen had fulRlled his ministry for two years, he
was succeeded by Xystus. To him Dionysius penned
a second letter on Baptism, showing the opinion and
decision both of stephen and of the οther bishops.
About stephen he speaks thus: ‘‘Νow he had written
fonnerly with reference both to Ηelenus and Firmilian
and all those from Cilicia and Cappadocia and,
in fact, Galatia and all the prorinees that border on
these, to the eKect that he would not hold communion
in future with them either, for this same
reason; since, says he, they rebaptize heretics.
Αnd look thou at the importance of the matter. For
deerees on this question have been actually passed
in the largest synods of bishops, as 1 learn, so that
those who come over from heresies are nrst placed
under instruction, then washed and purged again
from the ffith of the old and impure leaven. Αnd I
wote beseeching him οn all these matters.”</p>
<p>Αnd, after other remarks, he says: “Αnd to οur
beloved fellow-presbyters aho, Dionysius and Philemon,
who had formerly been of the same opinion
as stephen and mote [some letters] to me about the
same matters, at Rrst I wrote briefly, but now at
greater length.”</p>

thus: “For as to the doetrine now set on foot at
Ρtοlemais in the Pentapolis, an impious doctrine
which contains great blasphemy concerning the
Almighty ood, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
great unbelief as to Ηis only-begotten Son, the
firstborn of all creation, the word who was made
man, and whieh is without pereeption of the Ηοly
Spirit, — when there eame to me nom both both both
documents and also the brethren who were ready to
discuss the question, I wrote some letters, as 1 was
able by the help of God, giving an exposition of the
marter in a somewhat didactic manner; οf which <lb n="1"/>
scnd thee the copies.”</p>
<p>VII. Αnd in the third οf those on Baptism, which
the same Dionysius wrote to Philemon the Roman
presbyter, he relates the following: “But as for
me, 1 read both the compositions and the traditions
ofthe heretics, polluting my soul for a little with their
abominable thoughts, yet all the while deriving this
advantage from them, that I could refute them for
myself and loathed them far more. Αnd indeed a
certain brother, one of the presbyters, attempted to
dissuade and frighten me from becoming involved in
the mire of their wickedness, for he said that I should
injure my own soul; and said truly, as Ι perceived.

and a word of command was given me, saying expressly:

<p>Αnd again, after a protracted discussiOn of the

Dionysius of Rome, who at that time had been deemed
worthy of the presbyterate, but not long afterwards
received also the episcopate there. from it one may
learn how that he too had witness paid him by
Dionysius Alexandria for his learning and admirable
qualities. In the course of his letter to him he
mentions the affair of Novatus in the following terms:
VIII. “For it is with good reason indeed that we
feel enmity towards Novatian, who caused a
in the church and drew away some of the brethren
to impieues and blasphemies, and introduced as well
most profane teaching about God, and falsely accouses
our most compassionate Lord Jesus Christ of being
without mercy; and above all this, he sets at naught
the holy washing, and overturns the faith and confession
that precede it, and entirely banishes the Ηoly
sprit from them, even though there was some hope
οf Ηis remaining with or even returning to them.”</p>
<p>IX. Αnd his fifth letter was written to Xystus,
bishop of the Romans. In it, speaking much against
the heretics, he sets forth the following thing that
happened in his day, saying: “of a truth, brother,
I have need of counsel, and ask an opinion of thee.
The following matter has come before me, and 1 am
fearful lest after all I be mistaken. of the brethren
who meet together for worship there is one, reckoned
faithful, of long stanffing, a member of the congregation
before my ordination, and, I think, before the
appointment of the blessed Heraclas. Having been
present with those who were recently being baptized,

with which he had been baptized by the heretics,
was not such as this and had nothing in common
with it inasmuch as it had been full οf impieties and
blasphemies. Ηe said that he was now altogether
pricked in heart and had not courage so much as to
lift up his eyes to God, after beginning with those
unholy words and deeds; and therefore he begged
that he night receive this most pure cleansing and
reception and grace. This I for my part did not dare
to do, saying that his long-standing communion with
us had been sufficient for this purpose. For since he
had heard the Thanksgiving and joined in saying the
Αmen, and stood beside the Table and stretched forth
his hands to receive the holy food, and had reeeived
it and partaken of the Body and Blood of οur Lord
ror a long time, I should not dare to build him up
again from the beginning. But I kept exhorting him
to be ofgood courage, and to approach for the participation
οf the holy things with firm faith and good

to approach the Table, and searcely, though invited,

the principate for less than two entire years, and then
were removed out of the way; and Valerian along
with his son Gallienus succeeded to the government.
Once more we may learn from his letter to Hermammon
the description that Dionysius gives of him
also; in Which he gives an account of the following
kind: “Αnd to John also it is likewise revealed:
‘Αnd there was given to him,᾿ says he, ‘a
speaking great things and blasphemy, and there was
given to him authority and forty and two months.᾿
Οne may wonder at both of these things 2 under
Valerian, and of them note espeeially the nature of
his previous conduct, 3 how mild and friendly he was
to the men of God. For not a single one of the
emperors before him was so kindly and favourably
disposed towards them, not even those who
said to have been openly Christians, as he manifestly
was, when he received them at the beginning in the
most intimate and friendly manner; indeed all his
house had been ffiled with godly persons, and was a
church of God. But the master and ruler of the
synagogue of the Egyptian magicians 4 persuaded
him to get rid of them, bidding him slay and pursue
the pure and holy men, as being rivals and dinderers
of his abominable and disgusting incantations (for
indeed they are and were capable by their presence
and sight, and by merely breathing on them and
uttering words, of the derigns of the baneful
demons). Αnd he advised him to perform unhallowed
rites, and abominable juggleries and illwhich

be observed, however, that Εusebius, whom he calls
a deacon, shortly afterwards was appointed bishop of
Laodicea in syria; and Maximus, of whom he speaks

his ministry to the brethren in Alexandria; but that
Faustus, who along with him was distinguished at

But during the perseeution of Valerian, of whieh we
are speaking, three persons at Caesarea in Palestine,
conspicuous for their confession of Christ, were
adorned with a divine martyrdom, becoming food for
wild beasts. of these οne was called Priscus, the
second Malchus, and the name of the third was
Alexander. It is said that these men, who were
living in the country, at first reproached themselves
for their carelessness and sloth, because instead of
hastening to secure the crown of martyrdom, they
were proving contemptuous of prizes, though the
present opportunity was bestowing them upon sueh

Fabius, the chureh at Αntioch, and Firmilian at
caesarea in Cappadocia; and moreover Gregory and
his brother Athenodore were ruling the churches of

on the death of Theoctistus, Domnus succeeded
to the episcopate, but after he had continued in office
a short time Theotecnus, our contemporary, was
appointed to succeed him. Ηe also was of the school
of Origen. But at Jerusalem, when Mazabanes had
entered into his rest, Ηymenaeus succeeded to the
throne, the same who was distinguished for very

mark of honour among the Romans, the vine-switch,
and those that obtain it become, it is said, centurions.
Α post was vacant, and according to the order of
promotion Marinus was being called to this advancement.
Indeed he was on the point of receiving the
honour, when another stepped forward before the
tribunal, and stated that in accordance with the
ancient laws Marinus could not share in the rank
that belonged to Romans, since he was a Christian
and did not sacrifice to the emperors; but that the
οffice fell to himself. Αnd [it is said] that the

When he saw that he was stedfast in confessing himeself

bishop there, approaehed and drew him aside in
conversation, and taking him by the hand led him
forward to the church. Οnce inside, he placed him
close to the altar 1 itself, and rairing his cloak a little,
pointed to the sword with which he was girded; at

book of the divine Gospels, and bade him choose

<p>Without hesitation he stretched forth his right

strengthened by Him, mayest thou obtain that thou

him before the court of justice. For the appointed

caesarea Philippit, which Phoenicians call Paneas,
is said that on a certain festival a victim is thrown
down among the springs that are shown there, on the
slopes of the mountain called Paneion, from which
the Jordan takes its source; and that it becomes
invisible in some miraculous way through the
power, a circumstance, they say, that is looked upon
by those present as a far-famed marvel. Νow
story goes] that once Astyrius was there when this
was being done, and when he saw the multitude
stuck with amazement at the affair, in pity for their
error he looked up toward heaven and besought God
who is over all, through Christ, to confound the
demon who was causing the people to err, and put an
end to the deception of these men. Αnd it is said
that, when he had thus prayed, of a sudden the
sacrifice floated on the surface οf the springs; and
thus their miracle came to an end, and no further
marvel ever took place in connexion with that spot.</p>
<p>XVIII. But since I have come to mention this city.
I do not think it right to omit a story that is worthy
to be recorded also for those that come after us. For
they say that she who had an issue of blood, and who,
as we leam from the sacred Gospels, found at the
hands of our Sariour relief from her affliction, came
from this place, and that her house was pointed out
in the city, and that marvellous memorials of the
good deed, which the Saviour wrought upon her, still
remained. For [they said] that there stood on a lofty
stone at the gates of her house a brazen figure in
relief a woman, bending on her knee and stretching

cloak and stretching out his hand to the woman; at
his feet on the monument itself a strange species of
herb was growing, which climbed up to the border
of the double cloak of brass, and acted as an antidote
to all kinds of diseases. This statue, they said, bore
the likeness οf Jesus. Αnd it was in existence even
to our day, so that we saw it with our own eyes when
we stayed in the city. Αnd there is nothing wonderful
in the fact that those heathen, who long ago
had good deeds done to them by our saviour, should
have made these objects, since we saw the likenesses
of Ηis apostles also, of Ρaul and Ρeter, and indeed
of Christ Himself, preserved in pictures painted in
colours. Αnd this is what we should expect, for the
ancients were wont, according to their pagan habit,
to honour them as saviours, without reservation, in
this fashion.</p>
<p>XIX. Νow the throne of James, who was the first
to receive from the Saviour and the apostles the
episcopate of the church at Jerusalem, who also, as
the divine books show, was called a brother of Christ,
has been preserved to this day; and by the honour
that the brethren in suecession there pay to it, they
show cleariy to all the reverenee in whieh the holy
men were and still are held by the men οf old time
and those of our day, because of the love shown them
by God. so much for these matters.
XX. But to resume. Dionysius, in addition to the
letters of his that were mentioned, composed at that
time also the festal letters which are still extant, in
which he gives utterance to words specially suited to

the Ρascha. Of these he addressed one to Flavius,
another to Domitius and Didymus in which also he
sets forth a canon based on a cycle of eight years,
proving that it is not proper to celebrate the festival
of the Ρascha at any other time than after the vernal
equinox. In addition to these he penned also another
letter to his fellow-presbyters at Αlexandria, and
others at the same time in different places. Αnd
these [he wrote] while the persecution was still
proceeding.</p>

to Αlexandria. But when faction and war broke out
there once more, since it was not possible for him to
discharge his oversight over all the brethren in the
city, separated as they were into one or other part
οf the faction, he again at the festival of the Ρaseha
communicated with them by letter, as if he were
someone in a foreign country, from Alexandria itself.
Αnd to Ηierax, after this, a bishop of those in Εgypt
he writes another festal letter, mentioning in the
following terms the faction prevailing among the
Αlexandrians in his day:</p>
<p>“But as for me, what wonder is it if I find it difficult
to communicate even by letter with those who
at some distance, seeing that it has become impossible
even for myself to coverse with myself, or to take
counsel with my own soul? Certainly, I have need
to write by letter to my very heart, that is, the
brethren that are of the same household and mind
with me, and citizens of the same church; and there
seems no possible way of getting this correspondence
through. For it were easier for a man to pass, I do
not say to a foreign country, but even from East to

West, than to traverse Alexandria from Αlexandria
itself. For the street that runs through the very
centre οf the city is harder to traverse and more
impassable than that great and trackless desert
through whieh Israel journeyed for two generations.
Αnd our calm and waveless harbours have become an
image of the sea, which, split up and made into a wall
on either side, they had for a carriage road, and in
the highway1 the Egyptians were drowned; and
from the murders that take place in them they oftentimes
appeared like a Red Sea. Αnd the river that
flows on past the city at one time appeared drier than
the waterless desert, and more arid than that in
whose crossing Israel so thirsted that Moses cried
out, and there flowed to them, from Ηim who alone
doeth wonders, drink out of the rock of flint. Αt
another time it overflowed to such an extent that it
submerged the whole neighbourhood, both the roads
and the fields, threatening to bring upon us the rush
of waters that took place in the days of Νoah. Αnd
always its course is defiled with blood and murders
and drownings, such as it beeame for Pharaoh by the
hand οf Moses, when it was turned to blood and
stank. Αnd What οther water could there be to
cleanse the water that cleanses all things? Ηow
could the great ocean that men cannot pass, if it were
poured upon it, purge this horrid sea? Or how could
the great river that goeth out of Εden, if it were to
divert the four heads, into which it is parted, into one,
the Gihon, wash away the gore? Or when might
the air, made foul by the vile exhalations on all sides,

dews are discharges from corpses rotting in all their
constituent elements. Yet men marvel and are at a
loss as to wheuce come the constant plagues,1 whence
the grievous diseases, whence the various forms of
death, whence the manifold and great human
mortality, why this greatest of cities no longer contains
within it so great a multitude of inhabitants,
from infant children up to those extremely advanced
in years, as it used formerly to support of those known
as men οf green old age! Νay, those of forty years
old and up to seventy were then so numerous, that
the full total of their number is not to be reached now,
when those from fourteen to eighty years have been
registered and reckoned together for the public foodration2 ;
and the youngest in appearance have become
of equal age, so to speak, with those who long ago
were the oldest.3 Αnd though the human race upon

and of those that are dying day by day. For as as it is
written of the firstborn of the Egyptians, so also it is
now: ‘There was a great cry; for there is not a house
where there is not one dead’: and would indeed that
it were but one !</p>
<p>“For of a truth many and terrible were the things
also that happened to us before this. Αt first they
drove us out, and alone we kept our festival at that
time also, persecuted and put to death by all, and
every single sport where we were afflicted became for
us a place of festive assembly, field, desert, ship, inn,
prison; but the brightest of all festivals was kept by
the perfect martyrs, when they feasted in heaven.
Αnd, after that, war and famine came upon us, which
we bore along with the heathen. Alone we endured
all the injuries they inflicted upon us, while we had
the benefit besides of what they wrought upon each
other and what they suffered: and we found our joy
once more in the peace of Christ, which Ηe has given
to us alone. But when the briefest breathing-space
had been granted us and them, there descended upon
us this disease, a thing that is to them more fearful
than any other object of fear, more cruel than any
calamity whatsoever, and, as one of their own writers
declared, ‘the only thing of all that proved worse than
what was expected.’ Yet to us it was not so, but,
less than the other misfortunes, a source of discipline
and testing. For indeed it did not leave us untouched,
although it attacked the heathen with great
strength.”</p>

οf themselves and clave to one another, visiting the
sick without a thought as to the danger, assiduously
ministering to them, tending them in Christ, and so
most gladly departed this life along with them;
being infected with the disease from others, drawing
upon themselves the sickness from their neighbours,
and willingly taking over their pains. Αnd many,
when they had cared for and restored to health οthers,
died themselves, thus transferring their death to
themselves, and then in very deed making good the
popular saying, that always seems to be merely an
οf courtesy: for ῾ in departing’ they became
῾their devoted’ 1 In this manner the best
at any rate οf our brethren departed this life, certain
presbyters and deacons and some of the laity, receiving
great commendation, so that this form of death
seems in no respect to come behind martyrdom, being
the outcome of much piety and strong faith. So, too,
the bodies of the saints they would take up in their
οpen hands to their bosom, closing their eyes and
shutting their mouths, carrying them on their
shoulders and laying them οut ; they would cling to
them, embrace them, bathe and adorn them with
their burial clothes, and after a little receive the same
services themselves, for those that were left behind
were ever following those that went before. But the
conduct of the heathen was the exact opposite. Εven
those who were in the first stages of the disease they
thrust away, and fled from their dearest. They would
even cast them in the roads half-dead, and treat the
unburied corpses as vile refuse, in their attempts to
avoid the spreading and contagion of the death-

<p>“He1 then, after inciting one of his emperors and
attacking the other, of a sudden disappeared altogether,
root and branch with all his family, and
Gallienus was proclaimed and acknowledged by all,
being at once an old and a new emperor, for he was
before and came after them; for in accordance with
that which was spoken to the prophet Isaiah: ῾ Behold,
the former things are come to pass, and new
things which shall now spring forth.’ 2 For as
a cloud speeds underneath the rays of the sun, and
for a short time screens and darkens it, and appears
instead of it, but when the cloud passes by or is
melted away, the sun that shone before again shines
forth and once more appears; so Macrianus, after
coming forward and getting for himself access to the
imperial power that belonged to Gallienus, is no
more, since indeed he never was, while Gallienus is
like as he was before; and the monarchy has, as it
attempted to dethrone Gallienus (10. 8). Ηe and his son
were subsequently defeated in battle and

Promises were also composed by him. The occasion
was supplied him by the teaching of Νepos, a bishop
of those in Εgypt, that the promises whieh had been
made to the saints in the divine scriptures should be
interpreted after a more Jewish fashion, and his
assdumption that there will be a kind of millennium
on this earth devoted to bodily indulgenee. Thinking
for example, to establish his own peculiar opinion
from the Apocalypse of John, he composed a certain
book on the subject and entitled it Refutation of the
Allegorists.2 Dionysius attaeked him in the books On
Promises, in the first of which he sets out the view
that he himself held with regard to the doctrine, and
in the seeond treats of the Apocalypse of John.
There, at the beginning, he mentions Νepos, writing
as follows about him: “But since they bring forward
in his ninth year he was, to use Dionysius's metaphor, “under
a cloud.”

a certain composition of Νepοs, on which they rely
greatly as proving indisputably that the kingdom
Christ will be on earth, let me say that in many other
respects I approve and love Νepos, for his faith and
devotion to work, his diligent study of the Scriptures
and his abundant psalmody, by which many of the
brethren have till this day been cheered; and I am
full οf respeetful regard for the man, all the more for
that he has gone to his rest already. But truth is
dear and to be honoured above all things,1 and one
must give ungrudging praise and assent to whatever
is stated rightly, but examine and correct whatever
appears to be unsoundly written. Αnd if he were
present and putting forward his opinions merely in
words, conversation, without writing, would be
sufficient, persuading and instructing by question
and answer ‘them that oppose themselves.’ But when
a book is published, which some think most convicing,
and when certain teachers, who consider the
law and the prophets of no value and disregard the
following of the Gospels and depreciate the epistles
of the apostles, yet make promises concerning the
teaching οf this treatise as if it were some great and
hidden mystery, and do not suffer the simpler of our
brethren to have high and noble thoughts, either
about the glorious and truly divine appearing οf οur
Lord, or οf our resurrection from the dead and our
gathering together and being made like unto Ηim,
but persuade them to hope for what is petty and
mortal and like the present in the kingdom of God —
then we also are compelled to argue with Nepos
our brother as if he were present.”</p>

<p>XXV. Then, in due course, lower down he speaks
thus, with reference to the Apocalypse of John:
“Some indeed of those before our time rejected
altogether impugned the book, examining it chapter
by chapter and declaring it to be unintelligible and
by chapter and declaring it to be unintelligible and illogical, and its title false. For they say that it is
not John's, no, nor yet an apocalypse (unveiling),
since it is veiled by its heavy, thick curtain of unintelligibility;
and that the author of this book was
not only not one of the apostles, nor even one of
ints or those belonging to the chureh, but Cerinthus,
e same who created the seet called “Cerinthian’’
after him, since he desired to affix to his own forgery
a name worthy of credit. For that this was the
doctrine which he taught, that the kingdom of christ
would be οn earth; and he dreamed that it would
consist in those things which formed the object of his
own desires (for he was a lover of the body and
altogether camal), in the full satisfaction of the belly
and lower lusts, that is, in feasts and carousals and marriages, and (as a means, he thought, οf procuring
d lowerd not lower lusts, that is, in feasts and
under a better name) in festivals and sacrinces
and slayings of victims.1 But for my part I should
not dare to reject the book, since many my brethren hold it in estimatin ; but, reckoning that my perception
οt dare to reject the book, since many brethren hold
is inadequate to form an opinion concerning it, I hold
what the interpretation of each several passage is in
some way hidden and more wonderful.2 For even
although I do not understand it, yet I suspect that
some deeper meaning underlies the words. For I

do not measure and judge these things by my own
reasoning, but, assigning to faith the greater value,
I have come to the conclusion that they are too high
for my comprehension, and I do not reject what I
have not understood, but I rather wonder that I did
not indeed see them.”</p>
<p>Moreover, after closely examining the whole book
οf the Apocalypse and demonstrating that it cannot
be understood in the literal sense, he adds as follows:
“After completing the whole, one might say, of his
prophecy, the prophet ealls those blessed who observe
it, and indeed himself also; for he says: ῾ Blessed
is he that keepeth the words οf the prophecy of this
book, and I John, he that saw and heard these things.’
That then, he was certainly named John and that this
book is by one John, I will not gainsay; for I fully
allow that it is the work of some holy and inspired
person. But I should not readily agree that he was
the apostle, the son Zebedee, the brother of James,
whose are the Gospel entitled According to John and
the Catholic Epistle. For I fonn my judgement from
the character of each and from the nature of the
language and from What is known as the general
construction of the book, that the John therein mentioned]
is not the same. For the evangelist nowhere
adds his name, nor yet proclaims himself, throughout
either the Gospel or the Epistle.”</p>
<p>Then lower down he again speaks thus: “ . . . But
John nowhere, either in the first or the third person.

puts himself forward: ῾ The Revelation of Jesus

God and his testimony, even of all things that he
saw.’ Then he also writes an epistle: ‘John to
seven churches which are in Asia; Grace to you and
peace.’ But the evagelist did not write his
even at the beginning of the Catholic Epistle, but
without anything superfluous began with the mystery
itself of the divine revelation: ‘That which was from
the beginning, that which we have heard, that which
we have seen with our eyes.’ It was in respect of
this revelation that the Lord called Peter
saying: ‘Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah:

up his name again: ‘I John, your brother and partaker
with you in the tribulation and kingdom and in
the patience of Jesus, was in the isle that is called
Patomos for the word of ood and the testimony οf
Jesus.’ Moreover at the close he speaks thus:
‘Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy
οf this book, and I John, he that saw and heard these
things.’</p>
<p>“That the writer of these words, therefore, was
John, one must beieve, since he says it. But What
John, is not clear. For he ffid not say that he was,
as is frequently said in the Gospel, the disciple loved
by the Lord, nor he whieh leaned back οn Ηis breast,

hearer οf the Lord. For he would have mentioned
some one of these aforesaid epithets, had he wished
to make himself clearly known. Yet he makes use
of none of them, but speaks of himself as our brother
and partaker with us, and a witness of Jesus, and
blessed in seeing and hearing the revelations. I
hold that there have been many persons of the same
name as John the apostle, who for the love they bore
him, and beeause they admired and esteemed him
and wished to be loved, as he was, of the Lord, were
glad to take also the same name after him; just as
Ρaul, and for that matter Peter too, is a common
name among boys of believing parents. So then,
there is also another John in the Αcts of the Αpostles,
whose surname was Mark, whom Bamabas and Ρaul
took with themselves, concerning whom also the
scripture says again: ‘Αnd they had also John as
their attendant.’ But as to whether it were he
was the writer, I should say Νο. For it is written
that he did not arrive in Αsia along with them, but
having set sail, the Scripture says, from Ρaphos Ρaul
and his company came to Ρerga in Pamphylia; and
John departed from them and retumed to Jerusalem.’
But I think that there was a certain other [John] among
those that were in Αsia, sinee it is said both that
there were two tombs at Εphesus, and that each of
ulc two is said to be ’s.</p>
<p>“Αnd from the conceptions too, and from the
tenns and their arrangement, one might naturally
assume that this writer was a different person from
the other. For there is indeed a mutual agreement
between the Gospel and the Εpistle, and they begin
alike. The one says: ‘In the beginning was
word’; the other: ‘That which was from the begining.'

the same words slightly changed: That which we
have heard, that wffihlch we have seen with our eyes,
that which we beheld, and our hands handled, concerning
the Word of life; and the life was manifested.’
For these words he employs as a prelude, since he is
aiming, as he shows in what follom, at those who
were asserting that the Lord had not come in the
flesh. Therefore he was careful also to add: ‘Αnd
that which we have seen, we bear witness, and

promise of the Ηoly spirit 4; the adoption of the
sons of God 5; the the ‘faith’ 6 that is demanded of us
throughout; ‘the Father’ and ‘the Son’7: these
are to be found everywhere. In a word, it is obrivlous
that those who observe their character throughout
will see at a glance that the Gospel and Εpistle have
one and the same complexion. But the Apocalypse
is utterly different from, and foreign to, these
writings; it has no connexion, no affinity, in any way
with them; it searcely, so to speak, has even a
syllable in common with them. Νay more, neither
does the Εpistle (not to speak of the Gospel) contain
any mention or thought of the Apocalypse, nor the
Apocalypse of the Εpistle, whereas Ρaul in his
epistles gave us a little light also on his revelations,
which he ffidJd not record separately.</p>
<p>“Αnd further, by means of the style one can
estimate the difference between the Gospel and
Εpistle and the Αpocalypse. For the former are not
only written in faultless Greek, but also show the
greatest literary skill in their ffiction, their reasonings,
and the constructions in which they are expressed.
There is a complete absence of any barbarous word,
or soleeism, or any vulgarism whatever. For their
author had, as it seemS, both kind of word, by the
free gift of the Lord, the word of knowledge and the
word of speech. But I will not deny that the other
writer had seen revelations and received knowledge
and prophecy; nevertheless I observe his style and
that his use of the Oreek language is not accurate,
but that he employs barbarous idioms, in some places

there are extant aho many others, as for example
those against Sabellius to Αmmon bishop of the

to Euphranor and Αmmon again and Εupοrus. Αnd
he composed on the same subject aho four οther

hesides these, and moreover lengthy books written
in epistolary form, such as those on Νature, addressed
to Timothy his boy, and that on Temptations, which
also he defficated to Euphranor. In adffition to
these, in writing also to Basilides, bishop of the

day a final synod of an ofexceedingly large number
ofbishops Was assembled, and the leader ofthe heresy
at Antioch, being unmasked and now cleariy condemned
of heterodoxy by all, was excommunicated
from the Catholich Church under heaven. The person
foremost in calling him to account and in utterly
refuting his attempts at concealment was Malchion,
a learned man, who aho was head of a sehool of
rhetoric, one of the Greek educational establihments
at Antioch; and, moreoVer, for the surpassing sincerity
of his faith in Christ he had been deemed
worthy of the presbyterate of that community. Ιn
faet, this man had stenographers to take notes as he
held a disputatiOn with Ρaul, wllich we know to be
eXtant even to tbis day; and he, alOne of them all,
was able to unmask that erafty and deceitful person.</p>

together, indited unanimously a ringle letter personally
to DiOnysius, bishop of ROme, and Maximus, of
Alexandria, and sent it throughOut all the provinces.
In it they make manifest to au their zeal, and also
the perverse heterodoxy of Ρaul, as well as the
arguments and questions that they addressed to him;
and moreover they deseribe the man’s whole life and

he joins in concealing both this and the other incurable
sins (though he knows of, and has convicted,
them), that he may have them under obligation to

themselves, to aecuse him οf his misdemeanours in

the emperor Aurelian, on being petitioned, gave an
extremely just decision regarding the matter, order
the assignment οf the building to those with
hom the bishops of the doctrine 1 in Italy and Rome
should communicate in writting. Thus, then, was the
aforesaid man driven with the utmost indignity from
the church by the ruler of this world.</p>
<p>such indeed was the disposition οf Aurelian towards
us at that time. But as his reign advanced, he
changed his mind with regard to us, and was now
being moved by certain counsels to stir up persecution
against us; and there was great talk about this on
all sides. But as he was just οn the point οf so doing
and was putting, one might almost say, his signature
to the decrees against us, the divine Justice visited
him, and pinioned his arms, so to speak, to prevent
his undertaking. Thus it was clearly shown for all
to see that the rulers of this world would never find
it easy to proeeed against the churches of Christ,
unless the hand which champions us were to permit
this to be done, as a divine and heavenly judgement
to chasten and turn us, at whatsoever times it should
approve. At all events, when Aurelian had reigned
r six years, 2 he was suceeeded by Ρrobus. Ηe held

the ministry Dionysius, bishop of Rome, who had
completed nine years.</p>

his devil-possessed heresy, was taking as his armour
mental delusion; for the devil, that is Satan himself,
the adversary of God, had put the man forward for
the destruction of many. Ηis very speech and
manners proclaimed him a barbarian in mode of life,
and, being by nature devilish and insane, he suited
his endeavours thereto and attempted to pose as
Christ: at one time giving out that he was the
Paraclete and the Ηoly spirit Himself, conceited
fool that he was, as well as mad; at another time
choosing, as Christ did, twelve disciples as associates
in his new-fangled system. In short, he stitched
together false and godless doctrines that he had
collected from the countless, long-extinct, godless
heresies, and infected οur empire with, as it were, a
deadly poison that came from the land of the Ρersians;
d from him the profane name of Manichaean is
still commonly on men's lips to this day. Such, then,
was the foundation on which rested this knowledge
which is falsely so called, which sprang up at the

Domnus, Timaeus was in charge of the episeopate of
Antioch, whom our contemporary Cyril succeeded.
During Cyril's episcopate we came to know Dorotheus,
a leamed man, who had been deemed worthy of the
presbyterate at Αntioeh. In his zeal for all that is
beautiful in divine things, he made so careful a study
of the Ηebrew tongue that he read with understanding
the original Ηebrew Scriptures. Αnd he was by

to the Romans. But when he pereeived that they
were getting angry at the proposal, “At any rate,”
said he, “I do not think you would contradict me if
I were to counsel that those who were superfluous
and in no wise useful to us ourselves, old women and
young children and old men, should be permitted to
o outside the gates whithersoever they wish. Why
keep we these persons with us to no purpose, seeing
ey are all but on the point of death ? why destroy
we with hunger the mained and crippled in body,
when we should support οnly men and youths, and
husband the necessary wheat for such as are required
to guard the city ? ” With some such arguments he
persuaded the assembly, and was the first to rise and
give his vote that the whole body of those who were
not required for the army, whether men οr women,
should depart from the city, because were they to
remain and uselessly stay therein, there would be no
hope οf safety for them, since they would perish with
unger. Αnd when all the rest of those in the

le of saving the whole of them that were besieged;
took care that first of all those belonging to the
urch, and then the rest remaining in the city, of
ages, should escape, not only those who came
der the terms οf the vote, but also great numbers
of others, passing themselves off off as such, who secretly
donned women's attire, and by his management left

of Laodicea was deemed worthy to have successively,
who by dinine providence, after the above-mentioned
war, had left the city of the Alexandrians to come
there. Νot a very great many works, indeed, were
composed by Anatolius, but enough have reached us
to enable us to perceive both his eloquence and his
great erudition. In these works he especially presents
his opinions with reference to the Pascha; from which
it may be necessary οn the present occasion to give
the following passage.</p>
<p>From the Canons of Anatolius οn the Pascha.1</p>
<p>“It has therefore in the first year the new moon
of first the first month, which is the beginning of the
nineteen-year cycle, on the 26th of Phamnoth according
to the Egyptians, but according to the
months of the Macedonians the 22nd of Dystrus, or,
as the Romans would say, the 11th before the Kalends
of April. The Sun is found on the aforesaid 26th of
Phamenoth not only to have arrived at the first sign
of the zodiac, but already to be passing through the
fourth day within it. This sign is commonly called
the first of the twelve divisions and the equinoctial
[sign] and the beginning of months and head of the
cycle and the starting-point of the planetary course.
But the preceding sign is the last of the months and
the twelfth sign and the last of the twelve divisions
and the end of the planetary circuit. Therefore we
say that they who place the first month in it, and
determine the fourteenth day of the Pascha accordingly,2
are guilty of no small or ordinary mistake.</p>

Αnd this is not our οwn statement, but the fact was
known to the Jews, those of οld time even before
Christ, and it was carefully observed by them. One
may learn it from what is said by Philo, Josephus and
Musaeus, and not only by them but also by those of
still more ancient date, the two Agathobuli, surnamed
the Masters οf Aristobulus the Great. Ηe was
reckoned among the Seventy who translated
sacred and divine Hebrew Scriptures for
Philadelphus and his father; and he dedicated books
exegetical of the Law of Moses to the same kings.
These writers, when they resolve the questions relative
to the Exodus, say that all equally ought to
sacrifice the passover after the vernal equinox, at the
middle of the first month; and that this is found to
occur when the sun is passing through the first sign
of the solar, or, as some have named it, the zodiacal
cycle. Αnd Aristobulus adds that at the feast of the
passover it is necessary that not only the sun should
be passing through an equinoctial sign, but the moon
also For as the equinoctial signs are two, the οne
vernal, the other autumnal, diametrically opposite
each to other, and as the fourteenth of the month, at
evening, is assigned as the day οf the passover, the
moon will have its place in the station that is diametrically
opposed to the sun, as may be seen in full
moon ; and the one, the sun, will be in the sign οf
the vernal equinox, while the other, the moon, will
οf necessity be in that of the autumnal. I know
many other statements of theirs, some of them
probable, others advanced as absolute proofs,1 by

the Passover and of unleavened bread ought without
exception to be held after the equinox. But I refrain
from demanding proofs thus composed from those for
whom the veil upon the law of Moses has been taken
away, and for whom it now remains with unveiled
face ever to behold as in a mirror Christ and the
things of Christ, both what Ηe learned and what
Ηe suffered.1 But that the hrst month with the
Ηebrews lies around the equinox is shown also by
the teachings in the Book of Enoch.” 2</p>
<p>And the same person has left behind an Introduction
to Arithmetic also in ten complete treatises, and, as
well, evidences of his Study and deep knowledge οf
divine things. Theotecnus, bishop of Caesarea in
Palestine, first had ordained him to the episcopate,
seeking to procure him as his successor in his own
community after his death, and indeed for Some Short
time both presided over the same church. But, the
synod with reference to Ρaul summoning him to
Antioch, as he was passing by the city οf the Laodiceans
he was retained there by the brethren, Eusebius
having fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Αnd when Anatolius also departed this life, Stephen
was appointed over the community there, the last
bishop before the persecution. Ηe won widespread
admiration for his knowledge of philosophy and other
secular learning, but he was not similarly disposed
towards the divine faith, as the progress of the
persecution cleariy proved, demonstrating that the
man was more οf a dissembler, more of a craven and
coward, than a true philosopher. But indeed the
church and her affairs were not destined to perish

was immediately proclaimed bishop of that community
by God Himself, the the Saviour of all, even
Theodotus, a man whose deeds themselnes proned
true his ritle to his own name and that of a bishop.
Ηe had reached, indeed, the first rank in the science
of healing bodies, but in that of curing souls he was
second to none among men, because of his benevolence,
sincerity, fellow-feeling and zeal towards those
that sought his aid; and he was also greatly denoted
to the study of divinity. Such a one was he.</p>
<p>But at Caesarea in Palestine Theotecnus, after
exercising his episcopal office in the most zealous
fashion, was sueeeeded by Agapius, whom also we
know to have laboured much, displaying a most
genuine regard for the gonernment of his people,
and with a liberal hand caring especially for all the
poor. In his day we came to known Pamphilus, a
most eloquent man and a true philosopher in his
mode of life, who had been deemed worthy of the
presbyterate of that community. It would be no
small undertaking to show the kind of man he was
and whence he eame. But of each particular of his
life and of the school that he established, as well as
his contest in various confessions during the persecution,
and the crown of martyrdom with which he was
wreathed at the end of all, we have treated separately
in a special work concerning him. Truly he was the
most admirable of those of that city; but as men
possessed of especially rare qualities in our day we

poverty and for his learning in philosophy. Ηe was
exceedingly well practised in the deeper study of
divine things and in expositions thereof, as well
in his public discourses in church. Meletius1 (educated
persons used to call him the honey of Attica)
was such as one would describe as a most accomphished
scholar in all respects. It is impossible to
admire sufficiently his skill in oratory, yet this might
be said to be his by a natural gift. But who could
surpass the excellence of his great experience and
erudition as well, because you would say, even on a
siIgle trial, that he was the most skilful and learned
man in all branches literature? Equally, too, was
his life distinguished for its virtues. We took note
οf him during the period of the persecution, as for
seven whole years he was fleeing in the regions οf
Palestine.</p>
<p>In the church at Jerusalem, after the bishop
Hymnaeus mentioned shortly before, Zabdas received
the ministry. Αfter no great time he fell
asleep, and Hermo, the last of the bishops up to the
persecution in our day, succeeded to the apostolic
throne that has still been preserved there to the
present day.2</p>
<p>Αnd at Alexandria too, Maximus, who had held
the episcopate for eighteen years after the death of
Dionysius, was succeeded by Theonas. In his day at
Alexandra Achillas, deemed worthy of the presbyterate
along with Pierius, was well known; he had
been entrusted with the school of the sacred faith,
having displayed a wealth of philosophy most rare

<p>Note on the Paschal Canons of
(ch. xxxii. 14-19).</p>
<p>The Ρaschal Table of Anatolius is based on the
supposition that after the lapse or every cycle of
nineteen years the full moons recur οn the same
days οf the month, and at the same hours. This
method of calculation, although not strictly accurate,
was an advance οn the eight-year cycle employed
by Hippolytus (vi. 22) and Dionysius of Alexandria
(vii. 20). Anatolius reckons as the first year of his

<pb n="245"/>
truly in accordance with the Gospel. Αfter Theonas
had given his utmost service for nineteen years, Ρeter
succeeded to the episcopate οf the Alexandrians, and
he too was especially prominent for twelve entire
years; he ruled the church for less than three entire
years before the persecution, and for the remainder
οf his days practised a life of severer discipline, and
cared in no hidden manner for the general good of
the churches. For this reason, therefore, in the ninth
year of the persecution he was beheaded, and so
adomed with the crown οf martyrdom.</p>
<p>In these books having concluded the subject of he
successions, from the birth of οur Saviour to the
destruction of the places of —a subject that
extends οver three hundred and five —come,
let us next leave in writing, for the information of
those also that come after us, what the extent and
nature have been of the conflicts in our own day οf
those who manfully contended for piety.</p>
<p>cycle that upon which “the new moon οf the first
month” (i.e. the Jewish Νisan οr Αbib,
to our March-April) falls upon March 22: he is,
however, in error about the vernal equinox, which
he places on Μarch 19 (§ 15, where Μarch 22 is
fourth day”) instead of March 21. Ηe
insists (as did also Dionysius) that the paschal full
moon must fall after the equinox, as opposed to those,
whom he mentions at the close οf § 15, who regarded
the full moon (“the fourteenth day”) if it fell
the day before the equinox, as the paschal moon.

<p>BOOK VIII</p>
<p>Having concluded the succession from the apostles
in seven entire books, in this eighth treatise we
regard it as one of our most urgent duties to hand
down, for the knowledge of those that come after us,
the events of our own day, which are worthy of no
casual record ; and from this point our account will
take its beginning.</p>
<p>I. It is beyond our powers to describe in a worthy
manner the measure and nature of that honour as
well as freedom which was accorded by all men, both
Greeks and barbarians, before the persecution in our
day, to that word of piety toward the God of the
universe which had been proclaimed through Christ
to the world. Yet proofs might be forthcoming in the
favours granted by the rulers to our people : to whom
they would even entrust the government of the provinces,
freeing them from agony of mind as regards
sacrificing, because οf the great friendliness that they
used to entertain for their doctrine. Why need one
speak of those in the imperial palaces and of the
supreme rulers, who allowed the members of their
households — wives, children and servants — to practise
openly to their face the divine word and conduct,
and — one might say — permitted them even to
of the freedom accorded to the faith ? Αnd these
they used to regard with especial esteem and more

favourably than their fellow-servants. such a one
was the famous Dorotheus, who surpassed all in his
devotion and faithfulness to them, and for this reason
was more highly honoured than men who held positions
as rulers or governors. With him was the
celebrated Gorgonius and all those who, like them,
had been deemed worthy of the same honour because
of the word of God. With what favour one might
note that the rulers in every church were honoured
by all procurators and governors! Αnd how could
οne fully describe those assemblies thronged with
countless men, and the multitudes that gathered
together in every city, and the famed concourses in
the places of prayer ; by reason οf which they were
no longer satisfied with the buildings of οlden time,
and would erect from the foundations churches of
spacious dimensions throughout all the cities ? Αnd
as these things went forward with the times, and day
by day increasingly grew mightier, no envy could
stop them, nor was any evil spirit able to cast its
spell or hinder them by human devices, so long as the
divine and heavenly hand was sheltering and guarding,
as a worthy object, its own people.</p>
<p>But when, as the result of greater freedom, a
change to pride and sloth came οver our affairs, we
fell to envy and fierce railing against one another,
warring upon ourselves, so to speak, as occasion
offered, with weapons and spears formed of words ;
and rulers attacked rulers and laity formed factions
against laity, while unspeakable hypoerisy and pretence
pursued their evil course to the furthest end :
until the divine judgement with a sparing hand, as is
its wont (for the asseblies were still crowded),

agained that our affairs escaped all heed and oversight,

<p>II. Αll things in truth were fulfilled in our day, when
we saw with our very eyes the houses of prayer cast
down to their foundations from top to bottom, and
the inspired and sacred seriptureS committed to the

<p>But as to these, it is not our part to deseribe their
melancholy misfortunes in the issue, even as we do
not think it proper to hand down to memory their
dissensions and unnatural conduct to one another
before the persecution. Thererore we resolved to
place on record nothing more about them than what
would justify the divine judgement. Accordingly,
we determined not even to mention those who have
been tried by the persecution, or have made utter
shipwreck of their salvation, and of their own free
will were plunged in the depths of the billows ; but
we shall add to the general history only such things
as may be profitable, first to ourselves, and then to those that com after us. Let us proceed, therefore
from this point to give a summary deseription of the
sacred conflicts of the martyrs or the divine Word.

e churches to the ground and the destruction by
οf the Scriptures, and proclaiming that those who
ld high posiuons would lose all civil rights, while
οse in households, if they persisted in their profeson

uch was the first document against us. But not

presidents of the churches should all, in every place,
first committed to prison, and then afterwards

treated by scourgings ; another would be punished

ers, again, emerged from the connict otherwise :
e man was brought to the abominable and unholy
ifices by the violence of others who pressed round
him, and dismissed as if he had sacrificed, even though
e had not ; another who did not so much as approach
touch any accursed thing, when others had said
t he had sacrfficed, went away bearing the false
accusation in silence. Α third was taken up half-
ad and cast aside as if he were a corpse already ;

renegades in their piety toward the creator οf the
universe. For when the supreme commander, 1 whoever
he was, was just making his first attempt at persecuting
the soldiers — separating into elasses and
thoroughly sifting out those serving in the camps,
giving them a choice whether they would οbey and
enjoy the rank they held, or else be deprived of it,
if they continued to disobey the commandment — a
great many soldiers of Christ's kingdom, without
hesitation, unquestionably preferred to confess Ηim
than retain the seeming glory and prosperity that
they possessed. Αnd already in rare cases one οr
two of these were receiving not only loss of honour
but even death in exchange for their godly stedfastness,
for as yet the instigator of the plot was working
with a certrisln moderation and daring to proceed unto
blood only in some instances ; fearing, presumably,
the multitude of believers, and hesitating to plunge
into the war against us all at οnce. But when he
prepared himself still further for battle, it is quite
impossible to recount the number or the splendour of

if it were flesh for eating, were consumed by the fire,
not all at once, in case he might find immediate
release, but tittle by little ; nor were those who placed
him on the pyre allowed to desist, until, after such
sufferings, he should signify his assent to what was
commanded. But he clung fixedly to his purpose,

went around that it was the work οf our people : and

there, whole families and in heaps, were in some cases
butchered with the sword ; while others were perfacted

to the ground with fitting honours, their
reputed masters, starting afresh, deemed it necessary
to exhume them and cast them also into the sea, lest
any, regarding them as actually gods (so at least they
imagined), should worship them as they lay in their
tombs.</p>
<p>such were the things that were done in Νieomedia
at the beginning of the persecution. But not long
afterwards, when some in the district known as
Melitene,1 and again οn the other hand when
in syria, had attempted to take possession of the
Empire,2 an imperial command Went forth that
presidents οf the churches everywhere should be
thrown into prison and bonds. Αnd the spectacle οf
what followed surpasses all description; for in every
place a countless number were shut up, and everywhere
the prisons, that long ago had been prepared
for murderers and grave-robbers, were then filled
with bishops and presbyters and deacons, readers and
exorcists, so that there was no longer any room left
there for those condemned for wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the first letter was followed by others,
wherein the οrder had been given that those in
prison should be allowed to go in liberty if they
sacrfficed, but if they refused, should be mutilated
by countless tortures. Αnd then, once more, how
could one here number the multitude of the martyrs
in each province, and especially of those in Αfriea
and ³ and in Thebais and Εgypt ?

conspicuous in Palestine, and we know aho those at
Tyre in Phoenicia. who that saw them was not
struck with amazwment at the numberless lashes and
the stedfastness displayed under them by these
truly marvellous champions of godliness; at the
conflict with man-eating wild beasts that followed
immendiately on the lashes; the attacks that then
took place ofleopards and different kinds of bears, οf
wild boars and bulls goaded with hot iron ; and the
marvellous endurance οf these noble persons when
opposed to each οf the wild beasts ? We ourselves
were present when these things were happening,
what time we beheld the present, divine power of our
sariour, Jesus christ Himself, the Object of their
wintness, and the clear manifestation of that power to
the martyrs. The man-eating beasts for a considerable
time did not dare to touch or even approach
the bodies οf those who were dear to God, but made
their attacks on the others who presumably were
provoking and urging them οn from the outside;
while the holy champions were the only persons they
did not reach at all, though they stood naked,
waving their hands to drawa them οn to themselves
(for this they were commanded to do) ; and sometimes,
when the beasts would make a rush at them,
they would be checked by, as it were, some divine
power and once again retreat to the rear. Αnd when
this happened for a long time, it occasioned no small
astonishment among the spectators, so that, as the
first beast did nothing, a second and a third were let
loose against one and the same martyr.</p>

<p>One might be astounded at the fearless and valiant
bearing of those holy persons in the face of these
trials, and the steady, inflexible enduranee to be
found in young bodies. For example, you might
have seen a youth, not twenty years old in all,
standing unbound, his hands spread in the form of a
cross, and, with a mind undismayed and unmoved,
most leisurely engaged in earnest prayer to the
Deity ; never a with changing his ground or retreating
from the plaee where he had taken his stand,
while bears and leopards, breathing anger and death,
almost touched his very flesh. Αnd yet, by a divine
and mysterious power I cannot explain, their mouths
were muxxled, so to speak, and they ran baek again
to the rear. Such a one was he. Again you might
have seen others (for they were five in all) thrown
to a maddened bull, who, when others approached
from the outside, tossed them into the air with his
horns and mangled them, leaving them to be taken
up half-dead ; but when he rushed in threatening
anger at the holy martyrs as they stood unprotected,
he was unable even to approach them, though he
pawed with his feet and pushed with his horns this
way and that ; and though the goading irons provoked
him to breathe anger and threatening he was
dragged away backwards by Divine Prividence ; so
that other wild beasts were let loose against them,
since the bull in no way did them the shghtest injury.
Then at last, after the terrible and varied assaults of
these beasts, they were all butehered with the sword,
and instead of being buried in the earth were committed
to the waves of the Sea. VIII. Such was the
contest of the Egyptians who at Tyre displayed their
conffiets on behalf of piety.</p>

<p>But one must admire those of them also that were
martyred in their own land, Where countless numbers,
men, women and children, despising this passing
life, endured various forms of death for the sake of
οur Saniour's teaching. Some of them were committed
to the flames after being torn and racked and
grievously seourged, and suffering other mainfold
torments terrible to hear, while some were engulfed
in the sea ; others with a good courage stretched
forth their heads to them that cut them off, or died
in the midst of their tortures, or perished of hunger ;
and others again were crucified, some as malefactors
usually are, and some, even more brutally,
were nailed in the opposite manner, head-downwards,
and kept alive until they should perish of
hunger on the gibbet.</p>

martyrs in the Thebais endured as regards both
outrages and agonies. They had the entire body
torn to pieees with sharp sherds instead of claws,
even until life was extinct. Women Were fastened
by one foot and swung aloft through the air, head-downwards,
to a height by certain machines, their
bodies completely naked with not even a covering ;
and thus they presented this most disgraeerul, cruel
and inhuman of all spectacles to the whole company
of onlookers. Others, again, were fastened to trees
and trunks, and so died. For they drew together by
certain machines the very strongest of the branches,
to eaeh of which they fastened one of the martyr's
legs, and then released the branches to take up their

all at once of the limbs of those who were the objects
of this deviee. Αnd indeed all these thing were
done, not for a few days or for some brief space, but
for a long period extending over whole years—sometimes
more than ten, at other times above twenty
persons being put to death ; and at others not less
than thirty, now nearer sixty, and again at other
times a hundred men would be slain in a single (lay,
along with quite young children and women, being
condemned to manifold punishments which followed
one on the other.</p>
<p>Αnd we ourselves also beheld, when we were at
these places, many all at once in a single day, some
of whom suffered decapitation, others, the punishment
of fire ; so that the murderous axe was dulled
and, worn out, was broken in pieces, while the executioners
themselves grew utterly weary and took it
in turns to succeed one another. Ιt was then that we
observed a most marvellous eagerness and a truly
divine power and zeal in those who had placed their
faith in the Christ of God. Thus, as soon as sentence
was given against the first, some from one quarter
and others from another Would leap up to the tribunal
before the judge and confess themselves Christians ;
paying no heed when faced with terrors and the
varied forms of tortures, but undismayedly and
boldly speaking of the piety towards the God of the
universe, and with joy and laughter and gladness
receiving the rinal sentence of death ; so that they
sang and sent up hymns and thanksgivings to the
God of the universe even to the very last breath.

especially were marvellous who were distinguished

<p>for wealth, birth and reputation, as also for learning
and philosophy, and yet put everything second to
true piety and faith in our Saniour and Lord Jesus
Christ. Such was Philoromus ; who had been entrusted
with an office of no small importance in the
imperial administration at Alexandria, and who, in
connexion with the dignity and rank that he had
from the Romans, used to conduct judicia inquiries
every day, attended by a bodyguard of soldiers.
Such also was Phileas, bishop of the church of the
Thmuites,1 a man who was distinguished for the
services he rendered to his country in public positions,
and also for his skill in philosophy. Αnd though great
numbers of relatives and other friends besought
them, as well as many officials of high rank, and
though the judge himself exhorted them to take pity
on themselves and spare their children and wives,
they could in no wise be induced by this strong pressure
to decide in favour of love of life and despise
the ordinances of our Saviour as to confessing and
denying ; but with a brave and philosophic resolution,
nay rather, with a pious and godly soul, they
stood firm against all the threats and insults of the
judge, and both were beheaded.</p>
<p>X. But since we said 2 that Phileas deserved a high
reputation for his secular learning as well, let him
appear as his own witness, to show us who he was,
and at the same time to relate, more accurately than
we could, the martyrdoms that took place at Alexandria.</p>

<p>From the Writings of Phileas to the Thmuites.</p>
<p>“ Since all these examples and patterns and goodly
tokens are placed before us in the divine and sacred
Scriptures, the blessed martyrs with us did not hesitate,
but directed the eye of the soul sincerely toward
the God who is over all, and with a mind resolved on
death for piety they clung fast to their calling,
finding that our Lord Jesus Christ became man for
our sakes, that Ηe might destroy every kind of sin,
and provide us with the means of entering into
eternal life. For Ηe counted it not a prize to be
on an equality with God, but emptied Ηimself,
taking the form of a servant ; and being found in
fashion as a man, Ηe humbled Himself unto death,
yea, the death of the cross. Wherefore also,
desiring earnestly the greater gifts, the Christbearing
martyrs endured every kind of suffering and
all manner of devices of torture, not once, but even a
second time in some cases ; and though their guards
vied in all kinds of threats against them, not only in
word but also in deed, they refused to give up their
resolution, because perfeet love casteth out fear.
What account would suffice to reckon up their bravery
and courage under eaeh torture ? For when all
who wished were given a free hand to insult them,
some smote with cudgels, others with rods, others
with scourges ; others, again, with straps, and others
with ropes. Αnd the spectacle of their tortures was
a varied one with no lack of wickedness therein.
Some with both hands bound behind them were
suspended upon the gibbet, and with the aid οf certain

machines stretched out in every limb ; then, as
they lay in this plight, the torturers acting on οrders
began to lay on οver their whole body, not only,
as in the case murderers, punishing their sides with
the instruments οf torture, but also their belly, legs
and cheeks. Others were suspended from the porch
hy one hand and raised aloft ; and in the tension of
their joints and limbs experienced unequalled agony.
Others were bound with their face towards pillars,
their feet not touching the ground, and thus their
bonds were drawn tight by the pressure upon them
of the weight οf the body. Αnd this they would
endure, not while the governor conversed or was
engaged with them, but almost throughout the entire
day. For when he went away to others, he would
leave the agents of his authority to watch the first, if
perchance anyone should be overcome by the tortures
and seem to give in ; and he bade them approach
mercilessly with bonds also,1 and, when they were at
the last gasp after all this, take them down to the
ground and drag them off. For [he said] that they
were not to have the least particle of regard for us,
but to be so disposed and act as if we were no longer
of any account. Such was the second torture that
our enemies devised in addition to the stripes.
Αnd some, even after the tortures, were placed in
the stocks, and had both feet stretched οut to the
fourth hole, so that they were compelled to lie on
their back therein, being unable [to sit upright]
because of the recent wounds they had from the
stripes over the whole body. Others were thrown

<p>sale application οf the tortures ; presenting to those
who saw them a sight more terrible than did the
actual punishment, in that they bore on their bodies
marks οf the manifold and varied tortures that were
deVised. In this condition of affairs, some died
under their tortures, having shamed the adversary
by their endurance ; while others were shut up half
dead in prison, and after not many days perfected by
reason of their agonies ; the remainder recovered
under treatment, and as the result of time and their
stay in prison gained confidence. So then, when the
order was given and the choice held out, either to
touch the abominable sacrifice and be unmolested,
receiving from them the accursed freedom ; or not
to sacrifice and be punished with death : without
hesitation they gladly went to their death. For
they knew what had been prescribed for us by the
sacred Scriptures. For he says, ‘ He that sacrificeth
unto other gods shall be utterly destroyed᾿ ;
‘ Thou shalt have none other gods but me.᾿</p>
<p>Such are the words of the martyr, true lover both
οf wisdom and of God, which he sent to the brethren
in his community before the final sentence, when he
was still in a state of imprisonment, at one and the
same time showing the conditions in which he was
living, and also stirring them up to hold fast to the
fear of God in Christ, even after his death who was
just about to be perfeeted. But Why need one make
a long story and add fresh instance upon instance of
the conflicts of the godly martyrs throughout the
world, especially of those who were assailed no
longer by the common law, but as if they were

surrounded a little town in Phrygia, of which the
inhabitants were all Christians, every man of them,
and setting fire to it burnt them, along with young
children and women as they were calling upon the
God who is over all. The reason of this was, that all
the inhabitants of the town to a man, the curator
himself and the duumvirs with an the officials and
the whole assembly, confessed themselves Christians
and refused to give the least heed to those who bade
them commit idolatry.</p>
<p>Αnd there was a certain other person who had
attained to a high position under the Romans,
Adauctus by name, a man of illustrious Italian birth;
who had advanced through every grade of honour
under the emperors, so as to pass blamelessly through
the general administration οf what they call the
magistracy and ministry of finance. Αnd besides
all having dostinguished himself by his noble
deeds οf godliness and his confessions οf the Christ οf
God, he was adorned with the crown of martyrodom,
enduring the conflict for piety while actually engaged
as finance minister.</p>

<p>But the end οf these calamities came when they
were now worn out with their excessive wickedness,
and were utterly weary of killing and surfeited and
sated with shedding blood, and so tumed to what
they considered merciful and humane conduct; so
that they no longer thought that they were doing
any harm to us. For it was not fitting, they said,
to pollute the cities with the blood of their own people,
or to involve in a charge of cruelty the supreme
government of the rulers, a govemment that was
well-disposed and mild towards all; but rather that
the beneficence of the humane and imperial authority
should be extended to all, and the death penalty
no longer innicted. For [they declared] that this
their punishment of us had been stopped, thanks to
the humanity of the rulers. Then orders were
given that their eyes should be gouged out and one
of their legs maimed. For this was in their opinion
humanity and the lightest of punishments inflicted
upon us. Hence, because of this humanity on the
part of gomess men, it is now no longer possible to
tell the incalculable number οf those who had their
right eye first cut out with a sword and then cauterized
with fire, and the left foot rcndered useless by
the further application οf branding irons to the joints,
and who after this were condemned to the provincial
copper mines, not so much for serrice as for ill-usage
and hardship, and withal fell in with various other
trials, which it is not possible even to recount;
their brave and good deeds surpass all reckoning.</p>
<p>In these conflicts verily the magnificent martyrs
οf Christ were conspicuous throughout all the world,

<p>XIII. Of those rulers of the churches who were
martyred in well-known cities, the first name that
we must record on the monuments to holy men, as a
martyr or the kingdom οf Christ, is that of Anthimus,
bishop of the city οf the Nicomedians, who was
beheaded. Of the martyrs at Antioch the best in
his entire life was Lucian, a presbyter of that community;
the same who in Nicomedia, where the
emperor was, proclaimed the heavenly kingdom of
Christ, nrst by word οf mouth in an Apology, and
afterwards also by deeds. Of the martyrs in
Phoenicia the most famous would be the pastors of the
spiritual flocks of Christ, beloved of God in all things,
Tyrannion, bishop of the church at Tyre, and
Ζenοbius, presbyter of the church at Sidon, and,
moreover, Silvanus, bishop οf the churches about
Εmesa. The last-named became food for wild beasts,
along with others, at Emesa itself, and so was received
up into the choirs of martyrs; the other two
glorified the word οf God at Αntiοch by their endurance
unto death; one of them, the bishop, being
committed to the depths of the sea, while that best
of physicians, Ζenobius, died bravely under the tortures
that were applied to his sides. Of the martyrs
in Palestine, Silvanus, bishop οf the churches about
Gaza, was beheaded at the copper mines at Phaeno,

mention the great glory of the community of Caesarea,
Pamphilus, a presbyter, the most marvellous man of

we shall record at the proper time. Of those at
Alexandria and throughout all Εgypt and the Thebais
who were perfected gloriously, the first that must
be recorded is Ρeter, bishop of Αlexandria itself, a
divine example of the teachers οf godlines in Christ;

Ammonius, perfect martyrs of Christ; and Ρhileas,
Hesychius, Pachymius and Theodore, bishops of the
churches in Egypt; and countless other famous

in other respeets displayed himself in a most favourable

no part in the war against us, but even preserved

down the church-buildings nor employ any other new

their husbands; and he made it his business thus to
assail persons neither undistinguished nor obseure, but

exceedingly frightened at every noise and superstitious,
and attached great importance to error with
regard to idols and demons. For instance, without
divinations and oracles he could not dare to move even
a nail's breadth, if I may say so. Accordingly, he
applied himself to the persecution against us with
more energy and persistence than those before him,
ordering temples to be erected in every city and
the sacred groves that had been destroyed through
long lapse of time to be restored with all diligence;
and he appointed idol priests in every locality and
city, and over them as high priest of each province
one οf those engaged in statecraft, who was the most
manifestly distinguished in every branch of the public
service, with an escort and bodyguard soldiers;
and he recklessly bestowed governments and the
greatest privileges on all charlatans, as if they were
pious and dear to the gods. Henceforward he vexed
and oppressed, not a single city nor even district, but
the provinces under him completely and as a whole,
by exactions of gold and silver and unspeakably
large amounts of goods, and by the heaviest assessments
and varied fines. Taking away from the
wealthy the possessions they had gotten from their
ancestors, he bestowed upon his train of flatterers
riches and heaps of goods in a gift. In truth
he carried his drunken excesses to such a point that
he became mad and deranged in his cups, and when

army to become enervated as a result of every kind
of wanton excess; encouraging governors and commanders
to proceed against their subjects with
rapacity and extortion, almost as if they were his
fellow-tyrants. Why need one recall the man's
disgraceful deeds of passion or reckon up the multitude
οf those whom he debauched ? In fact, he
could not pass by a city without continually ravishing
women and abducting virgins. Αnd in this he was
successful with all, save only with Christians. Despising
death they set at naught this his fierce
tyranny. For the men endured fire and sword and
nailings; wild beasts and enguffing in the sea:
cutting off and burning of limbs, stabbing and digging
out of eyes, and mutilation of the whole body; and,
in addition to these, hunger and mines and bonds:
thus showing on all occasions that they preferred to
endure for the sake of piety rather than transfer to
idols the honour due to God. Αnd the women, on
the other hand, showed themselves no less manly
than the men, inspired by the teaching of the divine
Word: some, undergoing the same contests as the
men, won equal rewards for their valour; and others,
when they were being dragged away to dishonour,
yielded up their souls to death rather than their
bodies to seduction. Α certain Christian lady, 1 for
example, most famous and distinguished among those
at Αlexandria, alone of those whom the tyrant ravished

anger; but punishing her with exile he possessed
himself of all her property. Α great number of

<p>These indeed were wonderful, yet most surpassingly
wonderful was that woman at Rome, 1 truly
the most noble and chaste of all those towards
whom the tyrant there, Maxentius, in conduct like
Maximin, attempted to act offensively. For when
she learnt that at her house were those who
ministered to the tyrant in such deeds (and she
also was a Christian), and that her husband, and he
too a prefect of the Romans, through fear had permitted
them to take and lead her off, she begged to
be excused for a brief space, as if forsooth to adorm
her person, entered her chamber, and when alone
transfixed herself with a sword. Αnd straightway
dying she left her corpse to her procurers; but by
deeds that themselves were more eloquent than any
words she made it known to all men, both those
present and those to come herearter, that a Christian's
virtue is the only possession that cannot be
conquered or destroyed. To such an extent, in
truth, did the two tyrants, who had divided among
them Εast and West, carry the wickedness that they
wrought at one and the same time. But who is

would be at a loss to find it in the persecution against

<p>XV. in fact, during the whole period of ten
of persecution there was no respite in their plotting
and warfare against each other. The seas were unnavigable,
and none, no matter whence they sailed,
could escape being subjected to all kinds of torments:
stretched on the rack and having their sides torn,
and being examined under all sorts οf tortures in case
they should possibly be coming from the enemy of the
contrary part, and in the end subjected to crucifixion
οr punishment by fire. Moreover, every place was
busy with the preparation of shields and armour, the
getting ready of darts and spears and other warlike
accoutrements, and of triremes and naval gear; and
no one expected anything but an enemy attack all
day long. Αnd subsequently the famine and pestilence
broke out among them, about which we shall
recount what is necessary at the proper time.</p>
<p>XVI. Such was the state of affairs that continued
throughout the whole persecution; which came
completely to an end, by the grace of God, in the
tenth year, 1 though indeed it began to abate after
the eighth year. For when the divine and heavenly
grace showed that it watched over us with kindly
and propitious regard, then indeed our rulers also,
those very persons who had long time committed
acts οf war against us, changed their mind in the
most marvellous manner, and gave utterance to a
recantation, quenching the fire of persecution that
had blazed so furiously, by means of merciful edicts
and the most humane ordinances. But this was not

For from the beginning up to that time they were
daily plotting further and severer measures against

But it was due to the manifestation of the DIvine
Providence itself, which, while it became reconciled

and was wroth with him as the chief author of the
wickedness of the persecution as a whole. For
verily, though it was destined that these things
should come to pass as a divine judgement, yet the
Scripture says, “Woe, through whomsoever the
offence’’ 2 Α divinely-sent punishment, I say,
executed vengeance upon him, beginning at his very
flesh and proceeding to the soul. For all at once an
abscess appeared in the midst of his privy parts, then
a deeply-seated fistular ulcer; which could not be
cured and ate their way into the very midst οf his
entrails. Hence there sprang an innumerable multitude
οf worms, and a deadly stench was given off,
since the entire bulk οf his members had, through
gluttony, even before the disease, been changed into
an excessive quantity of soft fat, which then became
putrid and presented an intolerable and most fearful
sight to those that came near it. Αs for the physicians,
some of them were wholly unable to endure
the exceeding and unearthly stench, and were
butchered; others, who could not be of any assistance
since the whole mass had swollen and reached a
point where there was no hope of recovery, were put
to death without mercy.</p>

<p>“Among the other measures that we frame for
the use and profit of the state, it had been our own
wish formerly that all things should be set to rights
in accordance with the ancient laws and public order <lb n="1"/>
of the Romans; and to make provision for this,
namely, that the Christians also, such as had abandoned. the
persuasion of their own ancestors, should
return to a sound mind ; seeing that through some
reasoning they had been possessed of such self-will
and seized with such folly 2 that, instead of following
the institutions of the ancients, which perchance
their own forefathers had formerly established, they
made for themselves, and were observing, laws merely
in accordance with their own disposition and as each
one wished, and were assembing various multitudes
in divers places: Therefore when a command of ours
soon followed to the intent that they should betake
themselves to the institutions of the ancients, very
many indeed were subjected to peril, while very
many were harassed and endured all kinds of death;
Αnd since the majority held to the same folly, and
we perceived that they were neither paying the
worship due to the gods of heaven nor honouring the
god of the Christians; having regard to our elemene y
and the invariable custom by which we are wont to
accord pardon to all men, we thought it right in this

they do nothing contrary to order. In another letter

<p>But the author or the edict, arter such a confession,
was immediately, though not for long, released from
his pains, and so departed this life. It is reeorded
that this same person was the prime author of the
calamity of the persecution; since long before the
movement of the other emperors he had used force
to turn aside [from the faith] the Christians in the
—and, first of all, those in his own house —
degrading some from their military rank, and heaping
the most shameful insults on others; and since he
was already threatening others even with death, and,
finally, had stirred up his partners in the principate
to the general perseeution. Ιt is not possible to pass
over the ends of these same emperors in silence.
Four, then, had divided the supreme povwer between
them. Those who were the more advanced in age
and honour 2 retired from the principate not two whole
years after the persecution began, as we have already
stated, and passed the remainder of their existence
like ordinary, private citizens. The end of their lives
fell out thus. The one who had attained the chief
place in honour and age 3 fell a victim to a prolonged
and most painful infirmity of the body; while he who
held the second place to him 4 ended his life by

<p>strangling: suffering this fate, in accordance with a
certain demoniacal predietion, for the numerous
crimes he had perpetrated. Of those after them, he 1
who held the last Place-the same who was the
orginator, as we stated, 2 οf the whole persecution —
suffered the fate which we have mentioned above 2 ;
but he who ranked next before him, that kindest and
mildest οf emperors, Constantius, passed the whole
eriod of his principate in a manner worthy of his
high office, and in other respects displayed himself in
a most benencent and favourable light to all; yea,
and he held himself aloof from the war against us,
and carefully preserved his God-fearing
from injury and harsh treatment; neither did he pull
down the church - buildings nor employ any οther
additional new device against us at all. So he has
had as his reward a truly happy and thrice-blessed
issue of his life; for he alone met with a favourable
and glorious end while he was still emperor, with a
lawful son, in all respects most prudent and godly, to
succeed him in the office. Ηe from the very first
was proclaimed by the armies most perfect Εmperor
and Αugustus; and he set himself to be an emulator
οf his father's piety towards our doctrine. Such was
the issue whieh befell, at different times, the lives
of the four men of whom we have written above. Of
these same persons, he of whom we spoke a little
while ago alone still remained, 3 and, in conjunction
with those who subsequently were admitted to the
principate, οpenly placed before all the aforesaid
confession in the document document was set out above.</p>

above 1 was promulgated broadcast throughout Αsia
and in the neighbouring provinces. Αfter this had
thus been done, Maximin, the tyrant of the Εast, a
monster οf imriety if ever there was one, who had
been the bitterest enemy οf piety toward the God
of the universe, Was by no means pleased with what
was written, and instead οf making known the letter
set forth above gave verbal commands to the rulers
under him to relax the war against us. For since he
might not otherwise gainsay the judgement of his
superiors, he put in a corner the law set forth above ;
and, taking measures how it might never see the
light of day in the districts under him, by an οral
direction he commanded the rulers under him to
relax the persecution against us. Αnd they intimated
to each other in writing the terms of the οrder.
Sabinus, for instance, whom they had honoured with
the rank of most excellent prefect, made known the
Εmperοr’s decision to the provincial governors in a
latin epistle. The translation of the same runs as

those also who seemed to follow customs foreign to
the Romans should perform the acts of worship due

unyielding determination of some was carried to such
a length, that neither could they be tumed back
from their οwn purpose by just reasoning embodied
in the order, nor did they fear the punishment that
threatened. Since therefore it has come about that
many by such conduct endanger themselves, in
accordance with the noble piety that is theirs, the
Divinity of our masters, the most mighty Εmperors,
deeming it foreign to their divine purpose that for
such a reason they should so greatly endanger these
men, gave commandment through my Devotedness
to write to thy Intelligence, that if any of the Christians
be found following the religion of his nation,
thou shouldest set him free from molestation directed

they further these measures by writing, but also
much more so by action. With a view to carrying
out the imperial will, as many as they kept shut up

as he was of that which is good, and plotter against

of the eastern parts) ; nor did he suffer matters thus
to be carried on for six entire months. Sumerous,
therefore, were his derivlees to overturn the peaee :
at first he attempted on some pretext to shut us out
from assembling in the cemeteries, 2 then through the
medium of certain evil men he sent embassies to
himself against us, having urged the citizens of
Antioch to ask that they might obtain from him, as
a very great boon, that he should in no wise permit
any οf the Christians to inhabit their land, and to
contrive that others should make the same suggestion.

in the person of Theotecnus, a clever cheat and an
evil man, and quite unlike his name. 3 Ηe was
accounted to hold the post of curator 4 in the city.</p>

cause even of death to countless numbers, he ended
by erecting a statue of Zeus the Befriender with
certain juggleries and soreeries, and having devised
unhallowed rites for it and ill-omened initiations
abominable purifications, 1 he exhibited his wonderworking
by what oraeles he pleased, even in the
Emperor's presence. Αnd moreover this fellow, in
order to flatter and please him who was ruling, stirred
up the demon against the Christians, and said that
the god, forsooth, had given orders that the Christians
should be driven away beyond the borderS of the city
and country round about, since they were his enemies.</p>
<p>IV. This man was the first to act thus of set purpose,
and all the other offieials who lived in the cities
under the same rule hastened to make a like decision,
the provincial governors having seen at a glance that
it was pleasing to the Emperor, and having suggested
to their subjects to do the very same thing. Αnd
when the tyrant had given a most willing assent
to their petitions 2 by a reseript, onee more the
persecution against us was rekindled.</p>
<p>Marimin himself appointed as priests of the images
in each city and, moreover, as high priests, those who
were especially distinguished in the public services
and had made their mark in the entire course thereof.
These persons brought great zeal to bear on the
worship of the gods whom they served. Certainly,

that some of those eminent in the divine Word were
taken, and received the sentence of death without
mercy.</p>
<p>Of these, three in Emesa, a city of Phoenicia, were

themselves Christians. Among them was a bishop,
Silvanus, exceedingly advanced in age, who had
exercised his ministry for forty entire years.</p>

greatest distinction over the communities at Alexandria—a
truly divine example of a bishop on account
of his virtuous life and his earnest study of the holy
Scriptures—was seized for no reason at all

beheaded, as if by the command of
Maximin. Αnd along with him many others οf the
Egyptian bishops endured the same penalty.</p>

the ruler on behalf οf the doctrine which he professed,

placed in your heart this saving thought οn account

presides οver your far-famed city, he who protects

οf the then prevailing winter season were withholding
their usual downpour upon the earth, and we were
visited with an unexpected famine, and on top of this
a plague and an outbreak οf another kind of disease.
This later was an ulcer, which on account of its fiery
character was called an anthrax. 2 Spreading as
it did οver the entire body it used to endanger greatly
its victims ; but it was the eyes that it marked οut

numbers οf men as well as women and children.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the tyrant had the further
trouble οf the war against the Armenians, men who
from ancient times had been friends and allies of
the Romans; but as they were Christians and
exceedingly eamest in their piety towards the Deity,
this hater of God, by attempting to compel them to
sacrifice to idols and demons, made of them foes
instead οf friends, and enemies instead οf allies.</p>

place in his time. These things, then, coming upon
him together and at the same time had constituted
the prelude of his overthrow. He himself, therefore,
was worn out along with his commanders in the
Armenian war: while the rest of the inhabitants of
the cities under his rule were so terribly wasted by
both the famine and the pestilence, that two thousand
five hundred Attic drachmas were given for a single
measure of wheat. Countless was the number of
those who were dying in the cities, and still larger οf
those in the country parts and villages, with the result
that the registers, which formerly contained the
names of a numerous rural population, were now all
but entirely wiped out; for one might almost say
that the entire population perished all at once through
lack of food and through plague. Some, indeed, did
not hesitate to barter their dearest possessions for
the scantiest supply of food with those better provided;
others sold off their goods little by little and
were driven to the last extremity of want; and others
again injured their bodily health, and died from
chewing small wisps of hay and recklessly eating

the midst of the streets they would beg for a small
οrsel of bread to be handed them, and with the
t breath in their body cry out that they were
ungry, finding strength for this most anguished of

enceforth adopted a hard and pitiless frame of

would be suffering the same misery as the beggars;
so that in the midst of market-places and

buried for many days, presenting a most piteous
ectacle to those who saw them. Some actually
came food even for dogs; and chiefly for this reason

uld not completely destroy because they were well
provided with food. Men, for example, in affluent
cumstances, rulers and governors and numbers of
cials, who had been left, as it were of set purpose

performing the last offices for the dying and burying

<p>ΙX. Thus in truth Constantine, who, as aforesaid,1
was Emperor and sprung from an Emperor, pious
and sprung from a most pious and in every respect
most prudent father, and Licinius, who ranked next
to him—both honoured for their
and piety—were stirred up by the King of
God of the universe and Saviour, two men beloved
of God, against the two most impious tyrants;
and when war was formally engaged, God proved
their ally 2 in the most wonderful manner, and
Maxentius fell at Rome at the hands of Constantine;
while he 3 of the Εast did not long survive him, for
he too perished by a most disgraceful death at the
hands of Licinius, 4 who had not yet become mad. 4</p>
<p>But to resume. Constantine, the superior of the
Emperors in rank and dignity, vas the first to take
pity on those subjected to tyranny at Rome; and,
calling in prayer upon God who is in heaven, and His
Word, even Jesus Christ the Saviour of all, as his ally,
he advanced in full force, seeking to secure for the
Romans their ancestral liberty. Maxentius, to be
sure, put his trust rather in devices of magic than in

Italy. The Εmperor, closely relying on the help
that comes from God, attacked the first, second and
third οf the tyrant's armies, and capturing them
with ease advanced over a large part of Italy, actually
coming very near to Rome itself. Then, that he
might not be compelled because of the tyrant to
fight against Romans, God Ηimself as if with chains
dragged the tyrant far away from the gates; and
those things which were inscribed long ago in the
sacred books against wicked men—to which as
myth very many gave no faith, yet were they worthy
of faith to the faithful—now by their very
found faith, in a word, with all, faithful and faithless,
who had the miracle before their eyes. As, for
example, in the days of Moses himself and the ancient
and godly race of the Hebrews, “ Ρharaoh’s chariots
and his host hath he cast into the sea, his chosen
horsemen, even captains, they were sunk in the Red
Sea, the deep covered them’’; in the same way also
Maxentius and the armed soldiers and guards around
him “went down into the depths like a stone,”
he turned his back before the God-sent power that
was with Constantine, and was crossing the river that
lay in his path, which he himself had bridged right
well by joining of boats, and so formed into an engine
οf destruction against himself. Wherefore one might
say: “Ηe hath made a pit, and digged it, and shall
fall into the ditch which he made. Ηis work shall
return upon his own head, and his wickedness shall
come down upon his οwn pate.”</p>
<p>Thus verily, through the breaking of the bridge
οver the river, the passage across collapsed, and down
went the boats all at once, men and all, into the deep;

divine oracles foretell, sank as lead in the mighty
waters. So that suitably, if not in words, at least
in deeds, like the followers of the great servant
Moses, those who had won the victory by the help
of God might in some sort hymn the very same words
Which were uttered against the wicked tyrant οf old,
and say: “Let us sing unto the Lord, for gloriously
hath he been glorified: the horse and his rider hath
he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength

“Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods?
who is like thee, glorified in saints, marvellous in
praises, doing wonders?’’ These things, and such
as are akin and similar to them, Constantine by his
very deeds sang to God the Ruler of all and Αuthor
οf the victory; then he entered Rome with hymns
of triumph, and all the senators and other persons οf

he gave orders that a memorial of the Saviour's

deserted the worship of their gods, gods, the the immortal gods,

banished by the judges for the aforesaid reason, I

recall them to the worship of the gods. It came to
pass at that therefore, when when with
my injunction the judges observed what was commanded,
that no one in the eastem provinces was
either banished or suffered insult, but rather was
recalled to the worship the gods, because no severe
measures were employed against them. But afterwards,
when last year under happy auspices I had
gone to Nicomedia and was staying there, there came
to me citizens of the same city with images of the
gods, earnestly requesting that on no account should
such a nation be permitted to dwell in their city.

wished ; and if they so desired it, let them acknowledge

these same Nicomedians and the rest of the cities,
who themselves have so very earnestly addressed me
a similar request, namely, that no Christian should
inhabit their cities, I was compelled to reply in a
friendly manner, because the Emperors of old time
had earefully obesrved this very thing, and it was
plearing to the gods themselves, by whom 1 all men
and the government itself of the state subsist, that2
I should confirm sueh a request as they were

written to thy Devotedness before this time, and
likewise it has been laid down by ordinances that no
harsh measures should be adopted against provincials
who have a mind to persevere in such a custom, but
that men should deal with them in a long-suffering
and adaptable spirti : nevertheless that they may
not suffer insults or extortions at the hands of the
beneficiarii 3 or any others whatsoever, Ι think it
right by this letter also to put thy Firmness in mind
that thou shouldest cause our provincials to recognize
the attention they owe to the gods rather by
persuasive words and exhortations. Wherefore if
any should make it his resolve that the worship of
the gods should be recognized, it is fitting to welcome
sueh persons; but if some desire to follow their own
worship, thou shouldest leave it in their own power.

For this reason it behoves thy Devotedness to observe

people therefore dared to convene an assembly or
to present himself in public, beeause the letter did
not allow him even this. This alone it laid down,
that we should be kept from harsh treatment, but
it gave no orders about holding meetings or erecting
chureh-buildings or practising any of our customary
acts. Αnd yet the adnocates of peace and piety,
[Constantine had Licinius], had written to him to allow
this, and had conceded it to all their subjects by
means of edicts and laws. In truth, this monster of

and, above all, his soul was uplifted in an absurd
manner by an overweening arrogance, actually
against his colleagues in the Empire, men who were
in every way his superiors in birth and upbringing
and education, in worth and intelligence, and —
what is mort important of all — in sobriety and piety
towards the true God. so he began to venture to
act with insolence, and publicly to style himself first
in rank. Then he pushed his madness to the length
of insanity, and, breaking the treaty he had made
with Licinius, raised an internecine war. Νext, in
a short time he threw everything into confusion,
greatly disturbed every city, and, gathering together
all the anny, an innumerable multitude of men, went
forth to fight him in battle-array, his soul uplifted by
the hopes he placed in demons, whom, forsooth, he regarded
as gods, and in his myriads of armed soldiers.</p>
<p>But when he joined battle, he found himself
bereft of divine Providence, for, by the direction of
Ηim who is the one and only God of all, the victory
was given to Licinius who was then ruling. First of
all, the armed soldiers in whom he had trusted were
destroyed ; and when his bodyguard had left him
defenceless and wholly deserted, and had gone over
to him who was ruling,1 the wretched man
himself with all speed of the imperial insignia that
ill became him, and in a cowardly, base and unmanly
way quietly slipt into the crowd. Then he ran about
here and there, hiding himself in the helds and
villages ; and for all his courting of safety he escaped
with difficulty the hands of his enemies, his deeds
themselves proclaiming how very trustworthy and
true are the divine oracles, in which it has been said :

Since, therefore, before this it has been evident to our
knowledge that, on the plea that the most divine
Diocletian and Μaximian, our fathers, had
orders for the abolishment of the Christian assemblies,
many extortions and robberies have been practised
by the officials, and that this increased as time went
on to the detriment of our provincials (for whose
good it is our especial derire that there should be due
thought), and that their own personal possessions
were being destroyed : We addressed a letter to the
governors in eaeh province last year, laying it down
that if any should wish to follow such a custom or
the same religious observances, such a one should
adhere to his purpose without hindrance, and be
hindered or prevented by no one ; and that they
should have a free hand, without fear and suspicion,
to do whatsoever each one pleases. But it cannot
escape our notice even now that some of the judges
misinterpreted our injunctions, and caused our people
to have doubts with regard to our commands, and
made them somewhat backward in joining in those
religious observances that were pleasing to them.</p>

doubt arising from fear may be removed, we have
decreed that this ordinance be published, so that it
may be plain to all that those who desire to follow

Αnd permission has also been granted them to build
the Lord's houses. Nevertheless, that our bounty
may be even greater, we have decided to decree this
also : that if any houses or lands, which used formerly
to belong by right to the Christians, have by the
injunction of our parents into the right of the
public treasury or have been sriIed by any city—
whether a sale of these has taken place, or they have
been handed over to anyone as a gift — we have given

their original right, so that in this also all may perceive

being destroyed by fire and sword and given to wild
beasts and birds for food before his eyes, and were
enduring every kind of chastisement and punishment
and loss of life in the most pitiable manner, as if they
were godless and wicked, these he now allows both
to observe their fonn worship and to build churches ;

<p>Αnd when he had made these confessions, as if
meeting with some kind of reward on this very
account—that is, suffering less, to be sure, than
behoved him to suffer—he was smitten all at once
a stroke of God, and perished in the second
οf the war. But the circumstances of his death were
not such as fall to the lot of generah on a campaign,
who time after time contend bravely on behalf of
virtue and friends, and with a good courage meet a
glorious end in battle ; but he suffered his due
punishment like an impious enemy of God, skulking
at home while his army was still stationed in battlearray
on the neld. Αll at once he was smitten by a
stroke of God over his whole body, with the result
that he fell prone under the onslaught of terrible
pains and agonies; he was wasted by hunger, and
his flesh entirely consumed by an invisible, divinelysent
fire; the form which his body once possessed
wasted away and there and there remained only
a form οf dry bones, like some phantom shape long
since reduced to a skeleton, so that those present
could not but think that his body become the tomb
of his soul, which had been buried in what was now a
corpse and completely wasted away. Αnd as the heat
consumed him still more foerce;u in the very depths
οf his marrow, his eyes projected, and falling from
their sockets 1 left him blind. Yet he still breathed
in this condition, and making confession to the Lord
invoked death. So with his last breath he acknowledged
that he suffered thus justly because of his
violence against Christ ; and then gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>XI. when Maximin was thus removed — he who
as the only οne left οf the enemies of godliness,
d showed himself the worst of al — by the grace of
Almightly God the renewal of the churches from the
foundation was set on foot, and the word of Christ
received a due increase upon its fonner freedom, and
was clearly heard to the glory of the God of the universe;
; while the impiety οf the enemies of godlness
was covered with the most abject shame and dishonour.
For Maximin himself was the first to be
proclaimed by the rulers as a common enemy οf all,
and posted in public edicts on tablets as a most
impious, most hateful and God-hating tyrant. As
to the portraits which were set up in every city to
his honour and that of his children, some were hurled
from a height to the ground and smashed to pieces,
others had their faces blackened over with darkcoloured
paint and so rendered useless ; the statues
likewise, as many as had been set up in his honour,
were cast down and broken in the same manner,
and lay as an object of merriment and sport to those
who wished to insult or abuse them.</p>
<p>Next, all the honours of the other enemies of godliness
also were taken away, and all who were οf the

high government positions who had been honoured
by him, and who indulged in violent abuse against

countless Christians in Egypt; and in addition to
these not a few others, who were the chief means of
confirming and increasing Maximin's tyranny.</p>
<p>So it was that Theotecnus also was summoned by
Justice, who in no wise consigned to oblivion what
he did against the Christians. For after he had set
up the idol 1 at Antioch, he seemed to be prospering,
and had actually been deemed worthy of a governorship
by Maximin; but when Licinius came to the
city οf the Antiochenes, he made a search for charlatans,
and plied with tortures the the prophets and
priests of the new-made idol, to find out by what
contrivance they were practising this deceit. Αnd
when the infliction of the tortures made concealment
impossible for them, and they revealed that the
whole mystery was a deceit manufactured by the
art of Theotecnus, he inflicted a just punishment upon
them all, putting to death, arter a long series οf
tortures, first neotecnus himself, and then also the
partners in his charlatanry.</p>
<p>To all these were added the sons οf Maximin,
whom he had already caused to share the imperial
dignity and to be set up in paintings and pictures.2
Αnd those who formerly boasted kinship with the
tyrant and were moved by pride to lord it οver all
men underwent the same sufferings, accompanied
by the most abject disgrace, as those mentioned
above; for they received not correction, nor did
they know or understand the exhortatlon in the
sacred books which says : “ Ρut not your trust ln

<p>I. Thanks be to God, the Almighty and King of the
universe, for all things; and abundant thanks be also
the Saviour and Redeemer of our souls, Jesus
Christ, through whom we pray continually that
peace from troubles without and troubles in the heart
may be preserved for us stedfast and unidsturbed.</p>
<p>Αnd having now added, while we pray, the tenth
tome also of the Ecclesiastical History to those which
preceded it, we shall dedicate this tome to thee, my
οst holy Paulinus, 1 invoking thee as the seal of the
whole work; and fitly in a perfect number we shall
here place the perfect and panegyrical discourse on
the restoration of the churches, in obediencce to the
divine Spirit who thus exhorts us: “O sing unto the
Lord a new song; for he hath done marvellous
things: His right hand, and His holy arm, hath
wrought salvation for him. The Lord hath made
wn his salvation: His righteousness hath Ηe
revealed in the sight of the heathen.</p>
<p>Αnd verily, in accordance with the oracle, which
thus bids us, let us now cry aloud the new song, since,
after those terrible and gloomy spectacle and
narratives, we were accounted worthy now to behold

Antioch. Eusebius had a great admiration for him, and
dedicated to him not only this book but also his Onomasticon.

and to celebrate in panegyric such things as οf a
many righteous men and martyrs of God Before
desired to see upon earth and saw them not, and
hear, and heard them not. But they indeed
ting with all speed, obtained far better things in
the heavens themselves and were caught up into a
aradise of divine pleasure; while we, acknowledge
that even these present things are beyond our
, have been utterly astounded at the munificence
οf the bounty of which Ηe is the Αuthor, and
h our whole soul's might fittingly render Ηim
awe and worship, attesting the truth of the written
preedictions, wherein it is said: “came and behold
the works οf the Lord, what wonders Ηe hath
the earth, making wars to cease unto the ends of
the earth. Ηe break break the bow and shatter the
ur, and the shields he will bum with fire.”
Rejoicing that these things have been clearly fuld
to us-ward, led us proceed to take up οur
narrative.</p>
<p>The whole race of God's enemies had verily been
moved even as we have stated, 1 and in a moment
lotted out of men's sight; so that once more a divine
ying hath fulfilment, that which says: “I have seen
e wicked in great power, and lifted up like the cedars

in their effluence and a participation thereof.</p>
<p>II. So the whole human race was freed from the
oppression οf the tyrants. Αnd, delivered from his
former ills, each one after his own fashion acknowledged
as the only true God Him who was the
Champion of the pious. But we especially, who had
fixed οur hopes upon the Christ of God, had gladness
kable, and a divine joy blossomed in the hearts
of us as we beheld every place, which a short time
re had been laid in ruins by the tyrants'
deeds, now reviving as if after a long and deadly
destruction, and temples rising once more from their
foundations to a boundless height, and receiving in
far greater measure the magnificence of those that
formerly had been destroyed.</p>
<p>Yea, and Emperors, the most exalted, by successive
enacbnents on bahalf of the Christians, confirmed
still further and more widely God's bounty towards
us; and bishops constantly received even personal
letters from the Emperor, and honours and gifts οf
money. It may not be unfitting at the proper place
in this work, as on a sacred monument, to insert in this
book the text of these documents, translated from
Latin into Greek, so that they may also be preserved
in remembrance by all those who come after us.</p>
<p>III. After this there was brought about that
spectacle for which we all prayed and longed:
festivals of dedication in the cities and consecrations
οf the newly-built houses of prayer, assemblages of
bishops, comings together of those from far off
foreign lands, kindly acts on the part of laity towards
laity, union between the members οf Crist's body

in accordance with a prophetic prediction that
mystically signified beforehand what was for to come,
there came together bone to bone and joint to joint,
and all that the oracular utterance in dark speech
truly foretold. One was the power of the divine
Spirt that spread through all the members; all
were of one soul, and displayed the same zeal for the
faith; one hymn of praise to God came from the lips
of all Yea verily our leaders conducted perfect
ceremonies, and the consecrated priests pertonned

king of a new and far goodlier Jerusalem, or even a
new Zerubbabel who bestowed upon the temple of
God that glory which greatly exceeded the former;
and you also, ye nurslings of the sacred flock of Christ,

auditory of godliness grave and dear to God: Long
ago, as we listened to the reading aloud of those
passages of Holy Writ which told of the miraculous
signs that God gave and the wondrous deebs that the
Lord wrought for the serviee of men we could
hymns and songs to God and say, even as we were
taught: ‘We have heard with our ears, Ο God, our
fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their
days, in the days of old.’ But now indeed no

we behold that those things committed to memory
long ago are faithful and true; and so we can sing a
second hymn οf victory, and raise our voices aloud
and say: ‘As we have heard, so have we seen in
the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city οf οur God.’
Αnd in what city, if it be not the new-made city that
God hath builded, which is the chureh of the living
God, the pillar and ground of the truth; οf
also another divine oracle speaketh good tidings,
somewhat on this manner: ‘Glorious things are
spoken of thee, O city οf God’ ? To which city
since the all-gracious God hath gathered us, through
the grace of Ηis Only-begotten, let each ofthe

they said unto me, we will go unto the house οf the

house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.’

together with οne spirit and one soul, give honour and

praised, in the city of οur God, in his holy ’.
Yea verily, Ηe is truly great, and great is Ηis house,
lofty and large ; and more lovely in beauty than the
sons of men. Great is the Lord who only doeth
wondrous things. Great is Ηe who doeth great
things and past finding out; yea, glorious and marvellous
things of which there is no number. Great is
Ηe who changeth the times and the seasons, removing
kings and setting them up, raising up the poor from

needy. Ηe hath put down princes from their thrones,

so much virtue as to ml the ears and tongues of all
mankind upon earth with his name 7. what king,
when he had laid down laws so good and wise, Was
powerful enough to cause them to be published from
the ends of the earth and too the bounds οf the whole
world in the hearing of all mankind? who abolished
the barbarous and uncivilized customs of uncivilized
nations by his civilized and most humane laws ?
Who, when warred on by all men for whole ages, gave
such proof of superhuman might as to flourish daily
and remain young throughout his entire life? Who
established a nation never even heard οf since time

corner οf the earth but extendeth wherever the sun
shineth? Who so defended his soldiers with the
weapons of piety that their souls proved harder than
adamant when they contended with their adversaries ?

Greek and barbarian, with votive offerings οf his

could resist the will of the universal King and Ruler
and the Word of God Himself? Such things would
require a discourse of their own were one carefully
to exmaine and expound them at leisure. Υet
indeed the zeal of those who have laboured is not so
great or so noble in the judgement of Him whom we
address as God, when Ηe looketh into the lively
temple which we all compose, and vieweth the house
formed of living and firmly set stones, well and
securely grounded upon the foundation of the apostles
and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief
corner-stone; which stone the master–builders
rejected, not only of that old building which is no
more, but also of that building which compriseth
the more part of mankind to the present day, evil
workmen as they were of evil things; but the
Father approved it, and then and now builded it into
the head of the corner of this our common Church.
This living temple, then, of a living God Formed out
of ourselves, Ι mean the greatest sanctuary and truly
reverend, whose innermost shrine may noit be seen
by the common eye, for verily holy it is and a holy οf

of the universe, to whom alone it is peimitted to
search the hidden mysteries of every rational soul

one alone among equals, to take the second place
after Ηim, namely, for the commander who presideth
over this army, whom the first and great High Priest

cut down with axes as in a thicket of trees; whom

Moreover, since the Brdegroom, even the Word,
thus addresseth Ηis Bride, the sacred and Ηοly

your hands in the common prayers of you all, and
awake and raise up her who was desolate, who lay
like a corpse, οf whom men despaired, by the will of

God Himself created in Ηis own image, and everywhere
and in all things hath bestowed upon it the
divine likeness, an incorruptible nature, an essence
incorporeal, spiritual, a stranger to all earthly matter
and endowed with intelligence of its οwn; once for
all at the first Ηe fonned it into being from that which
was not, and hath made it a holy bride and an allsacred
temple for Himself and the Father. Αnd this

also Ηe Himself clearly showeth, when Ηe thus
confesseth: ‘I will dwell in them, and walk in them;
and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.’
Such then, is the perfect and purified soul, thus
begotten from the beginning so as to bear the image
οf the heavenly Word.</p>
<p>“But when through the envy and jealousy οf
demon which loveth evil she became of her own free
choice a lover of that which is sensual and evil, and
the Deity departed from her, leaving her bereft οf a
protector, she fell an easy capture and prey to the
snares of those who long had enried her; and, laid
low by the engines and machines of her invisible
enemies and spiritual foes, she fell a tremendous fall,
so that not even one stone upon another of her
virtue remained standing in her; nay, she lay her full
length upon the ground, absolutely dead, altogether
deprived of her inborn thoughts concerning God.
Yea, verily, as she lay fallen there, she who was made
in the image of God, it was not that boar οut of the
wood which we can see that ravaged her, but some
death-dealing demon and spiritual wild beasts, who
also have inflamed her with their passions as with
fiery darts of their οwn wickedness, and have set
the truly divine sanctuary of God on fire, and have
profaned the dwelling-place of Ηis name to the
ground; then they buried the hapless οne in a
great heap οf earth, and brought her to a state bereft
of all hope of salvation.</p>
<p>“But her Guardian, the Word, the divinely-bright
and saving one, when she had paid the just penalty
for her sins, once more again rertored her, hearkening
to the living-kindness οf an all-gracious Father.

upreme Emperors, by means of these men most
dearly beloved οf God Ηe cleansed the whole world
of all wicked and baneful persons and of the cruel
God-hating tyrants themselves. Αnd then
men that were Ηis disciples, who all their life long
had been consecrated to Ηim, yet secretly concealed,
as in a storm οf evils, by Ηis sheltering care, these
Ηe brought out openly and honoured worthily with
the great gifts οf His Father's bounty. Αnd by their
means Ηe once more purified and cleansed with
pickaxes and mattocks, namely, the penetrating
teachings οf Ηis instruction, those souls which a short
time before had been befouled and overlaid with
every sort οf matter and rubbish contained in impious
decrees; and when Ηe had made bright and
clear the place of the understanding of all of you,
Ηe then for the future consigned it to this all-wise
and God-beloved ruler. Ηe, discerning and

the whole people according to their several abilities;
with some he fenced the outer enclosure and this

were unable to support a mightier structure); to
others he entrusted the entrances to the house,
setting them to haunt the doors and guide the steps

the secondary beams of the light of Christ and the

preserved, has brought great dangers upon public

have bestowed the greatest good fortune on the
Roman name and singular prosperity on all the affairs

rewards of their own labours, most honoured Anulinus.
Wherefore it is my wish that those persons who
within the province committed to thee, in the Catholic
Church over which Caecilian presides, bestow their
service on this holy worship—those whom they
accustomed to call clerics—should onee for aIl be kept
absolutely free from all the public offices, that they
be not drawn away by any error or sacrilegious fault
from the worship which they owe to the Divinity, but
rather without any hindrance serve to the utmost

of plans to reward his benefactor with evil. Αt first,
indeed, he attempted to conceal the intrigue, and
feigned friendliness, hoping that frequent recourse
to guile and deceit would most easily secure his
expectationS. But God proved to be Constantine's
Friend and Protector and Guardian, who brought to
light the plots that were devised secretly and in
darkness, and confounded them. such power is
there in the great weapon of godliness to ward off the
enemy and to preserve its own in safety. Fenced
verily with this, our Emperor, most dear to God,
escaped the plots of this ill-famed master of intrigue.
Αnd he, when he saw that his covert design as by
no means going according to his wish (for God disclosed
every guile and wickeness to the Emperor
whom Ηe loved), since he was no longer able to conceal
himself, raised an οpen warfare. Αnd, to be sure,
in his decision to make war at close quarteb upon
Constantine, he was already hastening to battle also
against the God of the universe, whom, as he knew,
Constantine worshipped; and so he designed an
attack, quietly and silently at first upon his godly
subjects, who had never at any time done any harm
at all to his rule. Αnd this he did, because his innate
wickeness had perforee brought upon him terrible
blindness. Thus he neither kept before his eyes the
memory of those who had persecuted Christians
before him, nor of those whom he himself destroyed
and punished for the evil deeds they had pursued.
But he turned aside from the path of sound reason,
and becoming altogether mad, decided to make war
on God Himself, as the Protector of Constantine,
instead of on him who was being protected.

with regard to those who were suffering under imprisonment,
he laid down a law that no one should
treat them humanely by distributing food, or have
pity on those who were perishing of hunger in bonds ;
and that no one should be kindly at all, or do any
kindly action, even When they were moved by mere
natural feeling to sympathize with their neighbours.
Αnd of his laws this one at least was quite openly
shameless and the harshert οf all, in its putting aside
of every civilized, natural feeling, by which also it was
enacted as a punishment that those who showed pity
should suffer the same as those whom they pitied, and
that those who humanely ministered should endure
the same punishment as those who were undergoing
it, and be consigned to bonds and imprisonment.

one recount his innovations with regard to marriage,

were departing this life, wherein he dared to annul

he derised to the detriment of his subject peoples,
and the manifold exactions of gold and silver, the
revaluations of land, and the lucrative fines of men
in the country parts no longer alive but long since
departed? Αnd, moreover, as to the banishments
that this hater οf mankind inflicted upon those who
had done no wrong, the arrests of noble and highlyesteemed
men, whose wedded wives he separated
from them and consigned to certain abominable
members οf his household for disgraceful insult; as
to the many married women and unwedded giris with
whom this drunken old dotard satished his soul's
unbridled lust—why should one enlarge on these
things, when the outrageous character οf his last
deeds show the first to be small and of no account ?</p>
<p>For example, in the final stage of his madness he
proceeded against the bishops, and deeming them
opposed to his doings, as being the servants of the
supreme God, forthwith plotted against them, not
openly as yet (for he feared his superior), but once
more with secrecy and guile; and the most hlghly
respected οf these, by the contrivance of the governors,
he put to death. Αnd the manner in which they
were murdered was strange and hitherto unheard of.
For instance, the things that were done at Amasea
and the other cities of Pontus outdid every exeess of
cruelty. There some of the churches of God were
again thrown down from the top to the bottom;
others they shut up, so that none of the accustomed
worshippers might assemble or pay to God the
service due to Ηim. For he did not think that the
prayers were offered on his behalf—such such was the

that we did everything and supplicated God
on behalf of the Emperor whom Ηe loved. Hence
he hastened to vent his wrath on us. Αnd in truth
the sycophants among the governors, persuaded that
they were doing what pleased the impious man, plied
some οf the bishops with penalties suitable for malefactors,
and those who had done no wrong were
led away and punished, without a pretext, like
murderers. Αnd some endured at that time a more
novel form of death: their bodies were cut with a
sword into many pieces, and after this cruel and most
fearful sight they were cast into the depths of the
sea as food for fishes. Thereupon the men of God
began again to flee, and οnce more the fields, οnce
more the deserts, glens and mountains received the
servants of Christ. Αnd when the impious man was
thus suceessful in these measures also, he then conceived
the idea of stirring up anew the persecution
against all. Ηe had power to accomplish his purpose,
and there was nothing to hinder him carrying it into
effect, had not God, the Champion of the souls that
are His own, foreseeing with all speed what would
come to pass, caused to shine forth all at once, as
it were οut of deep darkness and most murky night,
a great luminary and sariour of them all, leading
thither with a lofty arm his servant Constantine.

God vouchsafe from heaven above the trophies of
victory over the wieked men; as for the guilty one,
Ηe laid him low, with all his counscellors and friends,

urtennost, the Εmperor, the friend οf God, reckoning
that he was no longer to be endured, summoned his
sound powers of reason, and tempering the stern
qualities of justice with humanity determined to
succour those Who were being evil intreated under
the tyrant's power; and hastened, by putting a few
spoilers out of the way, to reseue the greater part of
the human race. For hitherto, when he employed
humanity alone and showed mercy to him who was
undeserving of sympathy, there was no improvement
in Licinius: he did not give over his wickedness, but
rather increased his mad fury against his subject
peoples; while as for those who were ill-treated, no
hope of salvation was left for them, ground down
as they were by a terrible wild beast. Wherefore,
mingling a hatred of evil with a love of goodness, the
defender of the good went forth, with that most
humane Εmperor, his son Crispus, stretching out the
right hand of salvation to all who were perishing.
Then, inasmuch as they had God the universal King
and son of God, the Saviour of all, as their Ouide and
Αlly, the father and son both together divided their
battle-array against the haters of God on all sides
and easily Won the victory; 1 for everything in the
encounter was made smooth for them by God according
to His purpose. Tea verily, all at once and in
less time than it takes to say it, those Who the other
day were breathing death and threatening were no
more, nor was even so much as their name remembered;
their pictures and honours received a welldeserved
disgrace; and the things that Licinius had

of days gone by, these he himself also likewise
suffered; for neither did he receive correction nor
did he learn wisdom from the strokes that fell upon
his neighbours, but pursued the same path of iniquity
as they did, and justly reeled over the same precipice.</p>
<p>Thus was licinius cast down prostrate. But Constantine
the most mighty Victor, resplendent with
every virtue that godliness bestows, together with his
son Crispus, an Emperor most dear to God and in all
respects like unto his father, recovered the Εast that
belonged to them, and formed the Roman Εmpire,
as in the days of old, into a single united whole,
bringing under their peaceful rule all of it, from the
rising sun round about in the two directions, north as
well as south, even to the uttermost limits of the
declining day. So then, there was taken away from
men all fear of those who formerly oppressed them;
they celebrated brilliant festivals; all things were
filled with light, and men, formerly downcast, looked
at each other with smiling countenanees and beaming
eyes; with daneing and hymns in city and country
alike they gave honour first of all to God the universal
King, for this they had been instrueted to do, and,
then to the pious Emperor with his sons beloved of
God; old ills were forgotten and oblivion cast on
every deed of impiety; present good things were
enjoyed, with the further hope of those which were
yet for to come. Αnd, in short, there ẁ̀ere promulgated
in every plaee ordinances of the victorious
Emperor full of love for humanity, and las that
betokened munificence and true piety. Thus verily,
when all tyranny had been purged away, the kingdom
that belonged to them was preserved stedfast
and undisputed for Constantine and his sons alone;
