<note type="footnote">3. εἰ καί τισι τῶν πρὸ ἡμ.] He
prob. refers to Basil, who, in the Hom.
in Princ. Proverb. ἑ 3, where he has
no controversial animus, expounds
very strikingly the ’personification’
of that wisdom which speaks to us
out of nature. Very likely other
Catholic authors adopted the same
view. Bas. himself, however,
when in controversy with the Eunomians,
gives the same account as
Gr. does here (adv. Enn. iv p. 293
Ληπτέον οὖν . . . ἐπὶ τοῦ τὴν μορφὴν
δούλου λαβόντος). That account, it
may be added, is derived from
Athanasius, who says (de Deer. Nic.
Syn. p. 220 B), To δὲ πρόσωπον τοῦ

λοιπὸν λαβὼν τὸ σῶμα λέγει κτλ. Cp.
the fuller passage in Ath. Or. ii c.
Ar. ἑ 44 f.; also Eus. adv. Marcell.
ii 3. Among other expositors whom
Gr. knew, Origen (de Princ. i 2)
identifies Wisdom with the eternal
Son, and, though he does not admit
any imaginable period before the
generation of Wisdom, thinks that
Wisdom speaks of herself as having
been created, inasmuch as she comtains
in herself from the outset the
beginnings and outlines of the creation
that was to be. Denys of Rome
on the other hand (in Ath. de Deer.
Nic. Syn. Ρ. 232) dwells upon the
various significations of the word
κτίζειν in the Bible, and understands
it here to mean ’appointing,’ ‘setting
over the works which were
made through ’ For another
explanation, with which, however,
Gr. was hardly likely to be acquinted,

From what follows, it seems that Gr.

παῖδα = τέκνον or υἱόν.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ἐδοὑλ. σαρκί] Gr. seems to
be undecided whether to take πολ.
λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λένεσις,
πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν
οἶς κτλ. The ’Attic attraction’
οἶς misled De Billy into supposing
that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus
illis per quae). It is difficult to
determine whether the same mistake
caused the copyists to write κατεχομένους,
or whether Gr. himself
neglected to complete the attraction
by saying (as he should have done)
κατεχομένοις. That Ue ’s translation
is wrong is shewn by the
absence of the article before κατεχομένους;
if Gr. had meant ’and all
those things whereby He hath saved
those who were enslaved,’ he
have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. In view of
the preponderating authority for
κατεχομένους, it seems best to retain
it in the text, understanding it to be
a construction ad sensum, agreeing
with the οὓς which lies hidden in
the attracted ὄις.</note>

The difference is that in the earlier
sentences Gr. speaks of us as represented

were, and obey in Him. Here he
states the converse truth, that Christ
identifies His lot with ours; He
enters into our experiences in order
to know at first hand what obedience

learns by practical experience what
is demanded of us and what allowance

is unsatisfactory, so far as
συγχωρ. is concerned. It is best to
read ποσόν, and to make ἀπαιτ.,
συγχωρ., independent verbs coordinate
with δοκιμ., μετρεῖ. They thus
express the result of ’s gracious
experiment ; ‘ and a certain

thought is a favourite one with Gr.

σκότος is more concrete, so to speak,

<note type="footnote">4. ποσῶς καὶ καταλ.] The word

Christ escaped uninjured
from the temptation, it is not wonderful,
Gr. says, that we should

tempter but) even to some extent
be ’overtaken.’ The wonder is
that He should even have been
subject to assault, not that we
should fail under it.</note>

Here the point seems to lie not
only in the tense, but in the using,
with regard to transient things like
thunder and wind, such words as
στερεοῦν, κτίζειν (to found). The
explanation is that the ‘law’ or
‘principle’ of them (λόγος) was laid
down once for all, though the activity
which produces them
continues.</note>

looks as if this were said of the Manhood;
for the human will does not
always find it easy to conform to
the divine. The cry in Gethsemane
is a proof of it. But as it was only
the divine nature which came down ,
the will cannot be the human will.
Well, sentences of this kind do not
always imply the existence of the
thing whose activity is denied, but
quite the opposite. The Son has no
will of His own to do, apart from

<note type="footnote">ib. θεωθὲν ὅλον] It is strange
that Gr. should allow himself to
speak of the will of the Divine Son

possession of by ’), which might
imply that except for some action
of God upon it, the ’s will was
not divine. It does not wholly
remove the difficulty to say that the

is, like the ’generation’ of which

illustrations which Gr. proceeds to
give, it seems clear that the phrase
ἀπὸ κ. is used without any ref. to
τὸ κοινόν immediately before. With
the possible exception of the first,
they have nothing to do with the
peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists
between the Father and the Son.
We must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression
with a wider meaning. It is, however,
difficult to seize the exact
force of it. Elias appears to have
thought that it meant ’ in α way
that common intelligence discerns.'
It prob. means ’in a general way,'
as distinguished from a pedantic
adaptation to special situations.

<note type="footnote">1. καἰ οὐ θετικῶς] This is added
to bear out the assertion οὐχ ὡς
ὄντος, ἀλλ’ ὡς οὐκ ὄντος. The point
lies in this, that while the sentence,
rigidly analysed, implies the existence
of a fact, though it rejects an
inference drawn from the fact, the
speaker’s intention is to deny the
fact as well as the inference. Thus
οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου κτλ. implies that
the Spirit is ‘given,’ though not
‘by by measure ’ ; but in reality it
does not affirm the giving, any
more than the measuring. Again,
οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτία μου κτλ. implies
that the Psalmist was guilty of sin,
though that guilt was not the cause
of the opposition which he en-
countered ; but the Psalmist has no
intention of affirming his own sin.
Again, οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’. implies
that we have righteousnesses, though
we claim nothing on the ground of
them ; but St Paul would never
admit that we have any. Similarly,
’not Mine own will, but Thine’
implies the existence of a will of the
Son, apart from the ’s ; but
if we consider the expression ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ, in a broad way, in view of
the common use of language, we see
that no assertion of the kind is
intended.</note>

Elias takes it. But it might be

way, as if from σχέσις, ‘ ’

fact which Gr. notices may be
thought to tell in the opp. direction
: the absolute title seems to
denote the eternal relation, not the
temporary condition. See ’s

words mean to describe a property
which distinguishes the divine nature
from others. It is a common
property of all natures. ‘Man,’ for
ex., is not the name of a relationship,
but of a substantive thing ;
while ’husband,’ ’slave,’ 'Cappadocian, ’
which express a relationship,
are not the names of a nature.</note>

What we are in quest of, we find in
the name ὁ ὤν ; for τὸ ὂν is the
special property of God, and belongs
to Him in its entirety, not partially,
as it does to other beings, who only
have a share in existence. It is a
little surprising that Gr. does not
say τὸ δὲ εἶναι, instead of τὸ δὲ ὄν.
Perhaps it is because he has used τὸ
εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat
different sense (viz. of what a
thing is, rather than that it is) ; and
whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence
as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν
represents it as actually existing,
and so is better suited to denote the
fulness of the divine nature.</note>

does not see in the passage any ref.

inasmuch as He awards
in all cases what is meet and right.
As examples of such award, He
mentions the judging justly between
those under the law and those under
grace, and between soul and body.
Διαιτᾷν with the dat. is 'to arbitrate

The words from Ἰησοῦς to σωματικῶς
form the subject ; ὁ αὐτὸς πν. is the
predicate. The interpr. which Gr.
has just put upon the title χριστός
must be borne in mind. He seems
to take χθ. κ. σῆμ’ closely together,
in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during
these last few days,' — not, of course,
like πρώην τε καἰ χθές, excluding the
present, but including it. With σωματικῶς
cp. Col. ii 9; the adverbs
have no verbs to qualify, unless ὤν
or ὑπάρχων be supplied. For πνευματικῶς
= νοουμένας see WestCOtt on
Heb. ix 14. The sentence is therefore:
’Jesus, anointed with the whole
indwelling Godhead, who now for a
few days has been in bodily form, is,
considered according to the inward
principle of His being, the same
unchanged personality that He was
before His incarnation, and will be
so for ever.’</note>
