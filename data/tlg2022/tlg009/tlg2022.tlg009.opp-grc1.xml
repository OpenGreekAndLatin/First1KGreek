<note type="footnote">1. μ. δέ, οὐχ ἢν ἐν] ‘Not a souereignty
contained in a single person.’</note>
<note type="footnote">2. ἐστι γάρ] Such a sovereignty,
of a single person, does not necessarily
exclude the thought of discord
and confusion. It is possible to
conceive of a single entity being
divided against itself, and so becoming
many. The divine unity,
which we believe, is the result of
‘equality of nature, unanimity of
judgment, and identity of action’
‘of will.’</note>
<note type="footnote">5. πρὸς τὸ ἐν κτλ.] This complete
harmony of mind and will in
the Godhead is itself based upon
the concurrence of the other Blessed
Persons with that One of Their
number from whom They are derived,
viz. the Father. Gr. does not as
yet name the Father, nor indeed
any of the Persons, because he is
speaking in the abstract of the
divine unity and its conditions, and
so says τὸ ἐν and not rbv ἔνα. Α
comparison of v 14 shews that τῶν
ἐξ αὐτοῦ depends on σύννευσις, not
on τὸ ἐν. The ‘antecedent’ of ἐξ
αὐτοῦ (neut.) is τὸ ἐν.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. ὅπερ] refers to the whole fourfold
description. It is perhaps not
impossible that such an unity should
exist among creaturely beings, but
our experience suggests no instance
of it, — only imperfect images of it.
The clause is of course parenthetical.</note>
<note type="footnote">6. ὥστε] again refers to the
whole description. It will be seen
that οὐσία to Gr. means more than
φύσις. There is a moral element in
it, and not only a metaphysical;
ὁμοτιμία φύσεως is one of the things
which secure οὖσ’. μὴ τ. The reading
τῆ ἐξουσίᾳ gives no satisfactory sense.</note>
<note type="footnote">7. μονὰς ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς] The language
comes perilously near the
Sabellian conception of πλατυσμός
(see Dorner Person of Christ div. I,
vol. 2, p. 156); but of course Gr.'s
tenses κινηθεῖσα, ἔστη) are not to
be understood in a temporal sense.
There was no time before the κίνησις
of which he speaks. For μάρι see
ii 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">9. γενν. κ. προβ.] the γεννήτωρ,
of course, of the Son; προβολεύς, of
the Spirit.</note>
<note type="footnote">12. ἀφελών κτλ.] Gr. knows no
other way of expressing the relation
of the Son and Spirit to the Father,
such as might get rid of material suggestions.</note>

Gr.'s meaning here.</note>

<note type="footnote">2. πλὴν εἰ κτλ.) The only
way, Gr. says, is to adopt the
standard of Eternity. Eternity does
indeed suggest a kind of temporal
duration; that cannot be helped;
but we use it to denote ’an interval
or ’ commensurate with
things of a supra-temporal order,
not measured by any measurement
known to time. It seems best to
connect the πλὴν with εἰ καἰ μὴ δυνάμεθα,

<note type="footnote">4. If difficulty is felt about the
‘generation’ of the Son by the Father,
the difficulty is not got rid rid by
making the Son a ‘creature’ instead.
It only arises from a carnal notion
of what is meant by generation, as
if there could be no higher hind of
generation.</note>

Α work of creation (lit. ‘founding’)
as known to man involves time in
which to work it out, desire for the
accomplishment, the formation of
a mental ideal, thought as to the
mode of execution, etc. Gr.'s objeel
is to shew that the thought of creation

difficulties as that of generation.</note>

also to the Father's will, zvhich thus

the act of will which produced the
Son. Then, as other faculties of
the divine being are represented to
us as hypostatic — notably the Λόγος
— we are driven to suppose that
this primary faculty, antecedent and
necessary to the production of the
Son, is hypostatic also. If that is
the case, He does not owe His
being solely to the Father, but
partly also to the ’s Will,
which is thus constituted a kind of

the Son of one who willed to beget
Him, but only of that will itself.
But in so arguing they set up
a new, though fictitious, identity.
They converted the will itself into
a personal agency. This is what
Gr. combats. Will is one thing,
and the person who wills is another.
You might as well say that the
thing begotten is the son of beget-
ting, or trace the thing spoken to
speaking instead of the speaker, as
thus erect will into a substantive
and independent force.</note>

that He has two modes or stages of
existence, one before and the other

Or you will choose the

If τὸ ἀγέννητον constitutes

similar case can be made out for
these other predicates. Then, since
the divine nature is absolutely identified
with τὸ ἀγέννητον, and yet
at the same time with τὸ ἀθάνατον,
we are driven to suppose that these
are separate natures, or essences, or
that they compose the divine nature
by their aggregation.</note>

that to be unbegotten belongs
to God alone, though the assertion

not follow that unbegottenness is a

Adam alone was directly fashioned
by God; yet Seth is as truly man
as Adam. The divine essence is a
positive, not α negative thing. If
you ask me what it is, I can
answer that I hope we may know
some day, but not here. Meanwhile,

Gr., is a relative term; a ’ God ’
must be ’God of’ some one. If
then unbegottenness is the very
essence of God, and ‘unbegotten’
and ‘God’ are convertible terms,
then we must be able to say with
equal correctness, ’ the God of all ’
and ‘the unbegotten of all’; or
conversely, as the unbegotten is ’no
one's unbegotten,’ so God must be
‘no one's God.‘ The argument
does not seem a very valuable one,
because, to begin with, it must be
questioned whether ‘God’ is really
a term of relationship. If it be
so, then apart from creation God
would not be God. But the main
purpose of the argument is sound,
inasmuch as it shews the absurdity
of identifying absolutely the positive
existence of God with a merely
negative description. On Gr. ’s interprettation

— and when the Father comes,
and His ἀγέννητον is alone recongised
as divine, He does away
with the Son who occupied the

argument is one of mere mockery

great ingenuity to extract any meaning

thought that Gr. was making a
statement of his own belief, which
was that the name θεός is applied in
precisely the same sense to Father
and Son. But this ignores Gr.'s
argument, — and, it may he added,
the meaning of ὁμωνυμία. Gr.'s
immediate purpose is to shew that
the Eunomian illustration is, from
their own point of view, ill-chosen.
To be of any service to them, their
instance of ’equivocation’ should
have been one where the same name
is applied to two objects of very

<note type="footnote">1. συνάγωσιν] ‘conclude.’ The
Eunomian syllogism is this: ’The
Father is greater than the Son inasmuch
as the Son owes His existence
to Him. But the giving of existence
to the Son belongs to the Father by
nature. Therefore the Father is
greater than the Son by nature.’</note>
<note type="footnote">3. οὐ γὰρ ἁπλῶς κτλ.] The
reply is that not everything which
is predicated of a particular thing
(e.g. of Socrates) is predicated of the
nature which underlies that thing
(in the example chosen, human nature).
Everyone recognises what
the statements are intended to
apply to, and how they apply. So,
what we say of the Father does not
necessarily apply to the Divine
Essence which belongs to Him;
some things apply to Him as Father,
not as God.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. κατὰ τίνος, καὶ τίνα] The
words are interrogative; if Gr. had
intended the indef. pron., he must
have said δ. ὅτι κ. τ. It seems
necessary to understand κατὰ again
before τίνα, ’in regard to what
’ — i.e. in regard to nature, or
to individuality, or what. To take
the example given by Gr. at the end
of the section, if I say that Socrates
is a dead man, it is plain that I am
speaking of Socrates in particular
and of no one else, and that I am
speaking of Socrates in relation to
the bodily life, not about his soul,
nor about his influence.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. τί κωλύει κἀμέ] Two can play
at that game, Gr. says. He too can
draw that kind of conclusion, and
they shall see whether it will hold.
He makes a major premiss of that
conclusion of theirs, ’The father is
by nature greater than the ’
(We need not suppose that Gr. is
for the moment speaking of God:
the words would suit any father and
son.) The minor premiss is, ’But
he is not by nature necessarily greater,
or necessarily ’ So far there
is no absurdity. He need never have
had a son; there might have been
nothing else to compare him with.
(Gr., 1 repeat, is not speaking of
God.) The right conclusion would
be that the ’s ’natural’ superiority
over his son consists solely in
his fatherhood, and not in his nature,
—in his relationship, and not
in that which he is when considered
apart by himself. But the false conclusion
which Gr. draws, to illustrate
the false conclusions of the
Eunomians, is this: ’Therefore the
greater is not necessarily greater, ’ or
‘The father is not necessarily father.’
It will be observed that Gr. says
μεῖζον, not 6 μείζων, which makes it
clearer that the proposition is intended
to be quite general: Ἁ thing
which is greater than another need
not be greater, but might be at the
same time equal or less; a father
need not be his ’s father, but
might be his brother or his son.’
The second paralogism ὁ θεὸς οὐ
πάντως θεός) helps to shew that this
is Gr.'s meaning.</note>

arrangement of words like ὁ μέγας

<note type="footnote">1. γενόμενος Ἴ’., ὁ κάτω θεός]

intrinsic divinity of man. Cp. Or.
xxxviii 7 ἵνα...ὡς οἰκείοις ἤδη προσομιλῇ
. . . θεὸς ἑνούμενός τε καὶ

ἐχρίσθη θεότητι; iv 3 θεῷ πλακῆναι
καἰ γεμέσθαι θεὸν ἐκ τῆς μίξεως. The
language, if pressed, would imply
that Christ was a human person,
taken into union with a divine one.
This would, of course, be erroneous,
and Gr. 's own words immediately
before shew that he perfectly understood
the Person of our Lord to be
divine first, and then by condescension
human. Prob. the nom. to
συνανεκράθη is strictly supplied from
ἄνθρωπος, ὁ κ. θεός, not from ὁ νῦν σοι
καταφρονούμενος. The humanity of
Christ undoubtedly συνανεκρ. θεῷ.
Put the humanity of Christ, impersonal
except by virtue of His assumption
of it, is not exactly described
by the term ἄνθρωπος. The
rise of Nestorianism, which was
after Gr.'s time, would have suggesed
more careful phraseology;
and it may be added that a fear of
the still later Eutychianism might
have made Gr. modify the words
συνανεκράθη and τοῦ κρείττονος ἐκνικησαντος.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. ἵνα γένωμαι] It is perh. somewhat
νεανικόν to speak of our becoming

task to examine these objections; believers
are not fond of arguing; but
it is important to shew that the
arguments are not all on the side of
heresy. To rely upon logic, however,
is the abandonment of faith, the
evacuation of the Gospel, and its
betrayal. God bring the opponents
to a better mind, and grant us a
saving hold upon the Trinity.</note>
