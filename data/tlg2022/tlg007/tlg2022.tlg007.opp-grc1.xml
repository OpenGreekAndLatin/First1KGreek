<note type="footnote">1. Gr. complains of the verbosity
and contentiousness of his opponents,
unlike the brevity of St Paul. He
wishes they would turn their attention
to practice.</note>
<note type="footnote">I. πρὸς τοὺς ἐν λόγῳ κομψοὺς ὁ
λόγος] The Eunomians prided themselves
on their dialectical skill. Πρὸς
is not ‘ ’ but ‘ addressed to ’ ;
‘ My argument is addressed to those
who are smart in ’ There
is a shade of sinister suggestion in
the word κομψός.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. ἀπὸ τῆς γρ.] It is not Gr.'s
usual custom to take a text.</note>
<note type="footnote">2. ἰδοὺ κτλ.] Jer. 1 31 (LXX.
xxvii 31 ). The words added in b and
by Elias appear to be interpretative
addition. But the omission of
words clearly required by the sense
a little below throws some doubt on
the authority of acd when they omit
these here. If genuine, the accusatives
express the departments in
which the Eunomians display their
ὕβρις: ‘ Ο thou most proud — in
training, and hearing, and dis-
positon’ The · ἀκοὴν anticipates
the following reference to St ’s
words.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. τ. ἅκ. προσκνώμενοι] 2 Tim.
iv 3. St ’s word is κνηθόμενοι.
Gr. instinctively substitutes προσκν.
to prepare more easily for τοῖς ἡμ.
λόγοις, ‘ itching for our ’ Of
course they ‘ itch ’ for them in a
different sense from those of whom
St Ρ. speaks.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. τ. χεῖρα] They are prepared
to fight. Elias understands it of
itching to write against Gr.</note>
<note type="footnote">5.βεβ. κενοφ. κτλ.] Ι Tim. vi
20; 2 Tim. ii 16 ; cf. 1 Tim. vi 4 and

<note type="footnote">1. περιττὸν κ. περίεργον] perhaps
’excessive in volume, and over-subtle
in character. ’ But the two words are
practically synonymous ; cf. I Tim.
v 13 φλύαροι κ. περίεργοι.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. τοῦ συντετμ. λόγου] Rom. ix
28 ; cf. Is. xxviii 22 (LXX.).</note>
<note type="footnote">2. ὁ τῶν ἅλ’. μαθητὴς κ. διδάσκαλοσ]
as distinguished from the professional
fessional training of the Eunomian
disputants. It is a bold thing, in
the face of Gal. i 12, to call St Ρ.
‘ the ’s disciple ’ : probably
it is for that reason that Gr. adds
‘ and ’ He appears to have
in view such incidents as Gal. ii 14
perhaps also the Pauline influence
discernible in St Peter's Epistles.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. δεινὴν ἔπιθ’. κτλ.] ’clever at
the employment of noble and choice
’ This way of using the com-
parative is familiar; it almost = nobilissimis
quibusque uerbis.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. οὕτω τι καί] biting irony. Even
a little attention to conduct would
make a great difference. ‘Aσχολεῖσθαι
σθαι = ‘ to occupy oneself. ’</note>
<note type="footnote">6. καὶ ἴσως] The phrase means
(continuing the irony) that in that
case the chances would not be very
remote.</note>
<note type="footnote">7. κυβισταὶ λόγων] ‘ word-tum-blers.'
Κυβιστὴς (more usually κυβιστητήρ)
is one who stands on his
head, or turns head over heels, or
(according to Elias) a diver. The
reading κυβευταὶ ’dicers,’ or ‘sharper's
(cf. Eph. iv 14), would not suggest
the ‘ ridiculous ’ image which Gr.
half apologizes for using.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. ἄτοποι κ. παράδοξοι] ‘ strange
and ’ Ἅτοπος does not
seem to be used here, as it often is,
either in the sense of ’absurd,’ i.e.
unreasonable, or in that of ‘monstrous,’
’ i.e. wicked. Gr. only emphasizes
phasizes the surprising nature of the
feats which the Eunomians perform.</note>
<note type="footnote">2. No part of society is free
from their importunate wrangling;
Christianity is in danger of becoming
a matter of pettifogging logic. The
opponents must give a fatherly heart
leave to express its concern. If they
are not moved by what he says, they
will at least have the satisfaction of
rejecting and deriding it. He does
not intend to adopt their style.</note>
<note type="footnote">9. καταλύσαντες] ’having ’
stroyed ’ or ‘ broken up ’ ; both for
themselves and for their disciples.
Εὐσέβεια is here practical piety.</note>
<note type="footnote">10. ὅ τι δήσ. ἢ λῦσ’. τ. προβ.]
’They care for nothing but the opportunity
of tying or untying some
knotty proposition.‘</note>

legitimate skill in wrestling.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. τοιαῦτα] ace. after ἀμαθῶν,
‘ not versed in things οf the ’
ib. συναρπ. τ. ἐπαιν. ] an extension
of the metaphor of κλέπτει. ‘ Extorts

<note type="footnote">5. περιβομβεῖσθαι] όμβος, orig.
the humming of bees, comes to be
used of any insistent and continuous
noise.</note>
<note type="footnote">6. ἀποκναίεσθαι] ’to be ’
or ‘made wade tedious. ’ Demosthenes (564.
12) has the expression ἀποκναίει ἀηδιᾳ
καἰ ἀναισθήσιᾳ καθ’ ἑκάστην ἐκκλησίαν
ταῦτα λέγων, which (Jr. perhaps has
in mind.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. παραμυθεῖσθαι συμΦ. μ. τοῖς ζητήμασι]
De Billy and others understand
παραμ.= βαρύνεσθαι, comparing
Job xvi. 2 παρακλήτορας κακῶν,
which they take to mean ‘ abettors
of my afflictions.’ But this seems an
unnatural sense to put upon the verb,
and it would be hard to find a parallel
example. Gr. prob. means that the
worse calamity of their disputations
relieves the lesser calamity of sorrow.
The ’comfort’ in Ezek. xiv 22, 23 is
by some interpreted in this fashion.</note>
<note type="footnote">10. ἁπλ. σύντροφον] ’associated
with simplicity,’ ‘ used to ’ it ; a frequent
use of the word.</note>
<note type="footnote">11. ἀποσυλ. τ. π. λόγον ταχύτητι]
cf. James i 19. To rush into argument
is, in Gr.’s view, a desecration
of the flower of womanly modesty.
It is best to take ἄνθος as the object
of ἀποσυλ., γυναῖκ’. being the subject.</note>
<note type="footnote">12. τεχνύδριον] a diminutive of
τέχυη, like λογύδριον, χερύδριον, βιβλύδριον,
‘α little finicking profession.’</note>
<note type="footnote">13. τὸ μέγα ἡ. μυστήριον] 1 Tim.
iii 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">14. κατάσκοποι] usually thought
to be used instead of ἐπίσκοποι. But
there is no indication that Gr. was
chiefly thinking of heretical bishops.</note>

good, Gr. ironically says they will
at least have the advantage of in-
dulging in increased contempt for
their opponents.</note>
<note type="footnote">9. παράδοξον] i.e. what the Eu-

ΙΙ. νεανικῶς] ’ ’ ‘audaciously’; cp.

<note type="footnote">3. To speak on theological subjects
belongs only to men prepared by deep

It should be done only in seasons of
calmness, before serious hearers; and

Μοχθηρὸς is a word of many shades

<note type="footnote">4. τοῖς στεπποῖς τῶν λόγων] Though
Gr. is fond of the partitive gen. (οἱ
στερροὶ τῶν λόγων = οἱ λόγοι οἱ στερροί),
it seems best here to suppose
τοῖς ’στ’. to be neut., ’the solid qualities
of our discourses? Perh. Gr. is
still using the metaphor or simile of
food. It would seem to suit καταπιεσθέντες

τοῖς στερροῖς. Cf. Heb. v 12 στερεά

<note type="footnote">6. ζημ. καὶ εἰς τ. ἁ. δ.] The εἰς
does not denote the extent of the
damage, but the quarter in which it
is felt. Over-strong meat not only
fails to increase the vital forces of
those to whom it is administered;
it even impairs those which they
possessed. Cp. v 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. It is always right to think of
God; but not always suitable to discourse
of Him.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ἐπιφυέσθωσαν] ἐπιφύειν is ’to
plant upon ’ ; hence in pass. ‘to fasten
upon and cling ’ like hounds upon
a quarry. Plutarch frequently uses
the word in this way; e.g. § 1
ἐπιφυομένους, ὥσπερ θηρίοις εὐγενεῖς
σκύλακας. Gr. uses it again in v ιι.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. οἱ π. εὔκολοι] ‘ who are always
(lit. in all points) so agile and ’
ὕκολος (cp. δύσκολος), from κόλον,
’diet,’ means originally one whose
food agrees with him. Hence it
comes to be used for facility in any
direction. Plato Legg. 942 D uses
the substantive in the sense of bodily
activity, which (metaphorically applied)
plied) is the sense here.</note>

to the exclusion of all others, and so
to forfeit the ’many,’ and perh. the

incur a πενία, unknown to the faithful

Gr. does not concern himself with

Gr. requires before so doing (p. 4
supra); but the discipline must have
been hurried through ‘all in a day?’
ib. χειροτονεῖς θ....ἐμπνεῖς τ. π.]
The same thought carried on. These
men’s theology has come to them,
not by long study and careful training,
but by a touch or a breath.
Xειρ. prob. alludes to the act of
laying on of hands in Ordination,
though Gr. does not necessarily
imply that the men had been actually
ordained. The word, however, may
perh. only mean ‘elect?,’ ‘appoint.’
In either case the process is characterized
as both arbitrary and sudden .</note>
<note type="footnote">4. ἐμπνεῖς] Elias supposes a ref.
to such passages as Gen. ii 7 or Job
xxvii 3. If the allusion to ordination
in χειρ. were secure, it would
be natural to connect ἐμπν. with John
xx 22 (ἐνεφύσησεν). There is no
evidence, however, that any ceremony
of breathing was used in Gr.’s
time in ordaining; and it seems
simpler to regard the word as denoting
only a quick and miraculous
way of imparting the knowledge of
divine things.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. π. συνέδρια] So equipped,
the theologians pass to those ‘multitudinous
councils’ which were the
chief feature of Church History in
the fourth century. Gr., as is well
known, had no high opinion of
councils at the best (Stanley Eastern
Church p. 74). Λογίων points both
to the assurance with which these
men spoke, and to the source of their
inspiration (ἐμπνεῖς).</note>
<note type="footnote">6. ἐνδεσμεῖς] a rare word; ‘to

<note type="footnote">8. σχεδιάζεις] The verb denotes
what is hastily prepared out of the
first materials that come to hand,
‘to improvise.’ It thus returns to
the accusation that Gr.’s opponents
had had no proper training.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. δ. ἀνάδοσιν] Ἀναδίδωμι is to
‘yield,’ as the earth yields a crop, or
the spring a volume of water. Thuc.
iii 88 uses it of Aetna, πῦρ κ. καπνὸν
ἀναδ. So ἀνάδοσις is an ‘output’ or
‘outburst.’ Διαλεκτικῶν of course is
masc., ‘dialecticians.’</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. οἱ μ....τ. γίγαντας] Α contracted expression; ‘as the old fables did with the giants,’ meaning, ‘as the old fables said that the Earth brought forth the giants.’ It the metaphor of ἀνάδοσιν.

<note type="footnote">ib. ἀθείαν]=ἀθεότητα. The atheism
of Epicurus was of a practical,
rather than theoretical, nature. He
did not deny the existence of gods,
but their interference in the affairs
of men. See Zeller Stoics, Epicureans,
and Sceptics p. 464 foil.</note>
<note type="footnote">1. ἀτόμους] Epicurus, whose view
of the universe was purely meterialistic,
taught the eternal existence of
those "primary component parts of
things" which he called ’atoms.’
See Zeller op. cit. p. 439 foil.
ib. ἡδονήν] "The only unconditional
good, according to Epicurus,
is pleasure; the only unconditional
evil is pain": Zeller p. 473. By
ἀφιλόσοφον Gr. means ’unworthy of
a philosopher,’ On the character
‘pleasure’ as understood by Epicurus,
see Zeller p. 476 foil.</note>
<note type="footnote">2. τ. μικρολόγον πρόνοιαν] “Aristotle's
philosophy excludes the conception
of God's immediate interference
in the course of the universe;
and it would be illegitimate to attribute
to Aristotle the popular belief
in Providence": Zeller Aristotle and
the Earlier Peripatetics 1 p. 422 (cp.
p. 403 and 11 p. 328). The epithet
μικρολόγον would more naturally
apply to a providence concerned
with petty details; (Jr. seems to intend
it in a kind of passive sense,
‘of which mean things are ’
Cp. θνητοὺς λόγους just below.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. ἔντεχνον] ‘ the artificial character
of his system,’ Gr., as a master
of rhetoric, prob. has chiefly in view
’s work on Rhetoric, at the
beginning of which the word ἔντεχνος
frequently occurs.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. θνητοὺς π. ψ. λόγους] ‘ his
mortal language about the soul,’
is impossible to say that Aristotle
taught a doctrine of personal immortality.
He taught merely the continued
existence of thinking spirit,
denying to it all the attributes of
personality’’: Zeller op. cit.
p. 134.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. ἀνθρωπικόν] hardly distinguishable
here from ἀνθρώπινον: ‘the
purely human character of his determinations,’
i.e. the absence of anything
divine in his teaching.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. ὀφρύν] Lat. supercilium,
‘haughtiness.’</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. Κυνῶν] applied to the Cynics
as early as Arist. Rhet. 111 x 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. τὸ λίχνον κ. ἀγοραῖον, ‘the
greed and coarseness,’ Zeller
p. 290 speaks of the “coarse
and rude behaviour" of the later
Cynics, "their extortions and impositions,
and, despite their beggarly
life...their covetousness." Ἀγοραῖον,
cf. Acts xvii 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. τὸ κενόν, τὸ πλ. τ. ληρ.] oxymoron;
‘emptiness, full of absurdities.</note>

<note type="footnote">ib. ἐληλεγμένα] from ἐλέγχω.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. τὰ σά] It is difficult to see
why the subjects which Gr. classes
under this head should be so described
anymore than many of the foregoing.
It does not seem to mean ’Christian
’ rather than heathen; which
would more naturally have been
called τὰ ἡμέτερα; and besides, such
a subject as ὕλη has nothing distincteively
Christian in it. Prob. Gr.
means ’stick to a line of your own,’
as distinguished from being guided
by the movements of an adversary.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. τὸ ἐν τ. φιλότιμον] ‘an ambitious
subject in that line’: Cf.
above p. 17.</note>

entertained the notion of a 'plurality
of worlds.’</note>

means concerning its nature, origin,
and the like.</note>

Elias rightly understands Gr. to
mean good and bad angels.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ἐπιτυγχ...διαμαρτ.] ’to ’
’to miss,’ It certainly seems
that Gr. should consider it almost
a matter of inifference whether a
man were right or wrong upon such
matters as the last four which he has
mentioned. But this is evidently
the sense which is required. Prob.
he supposed that it was not possible
to go far wrong on such subjects.
Any interpretation of ’recompense,’
for instance, which was not really
a denial of recompense, would be
harmless in comparison with the
teaching upon the nature of Christ
to which Gr. was accustomed from
the Eunomians.</note>
<note type="footnote">9. ἐντευξόμεθα] used with a refer-
ence to ἐπιτυγχ. just before. Even
if we make a few mistakes on points
of subordinate importance, ’we shall
meet and converse with God.’</note>
<note type="footnote">10. ὀλίγα] does not seem to be
often used in the plur. in this adverbial
sense. It appears to suggest
the various occasions on which a
little of such intercourse is vouchsafed.
In the contrasted clause,
μικρὸν qualifies ὕστερον, and ἴσως
qualifies τελεώτ., ’soon after,’
more perfectly,’ ’—the ἴσως suggesting
a modest doubt concerning
our share in the great revelation.</note></p>
