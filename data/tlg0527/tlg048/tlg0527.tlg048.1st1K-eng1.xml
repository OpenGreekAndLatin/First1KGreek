<head>NOTES</head>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1"><p>1. 1. Ἀμὼς] Not the same name as the prophet Amos. The
ﬁnal letter is in Heb. y, i.e. ts, sometimes represented by z, as in
Zephaniah; or in Amaziah, of whom tradition makes this Amoz the
brother, but on no ascertainable grounds. (The Heb. names of Tyre
and Zidon both begin with this letter.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="2"><p>κατὰ] Either generally, ‘concerning Judah and ’: as
Ezek. xix. 4; or more definitely, ‘against,’ as in 2 Sam. i. 17, Matt.
11, Acts vi. 13. See Liddell and Scott on κατά, Α. 11. 5, 6; where
such instances as Plat. Apol. 37 B, Protag. 323 B (of persons) seem to
imply condemnation.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="3"><p>2. On the use of the aorist, see Vol. 1. Introd. ‘Methods of
Rendering,’ p. 43.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="4"><p>ἐγέννησα] Scholz considers that the Lxx. probably read a verb
from root ἢν instead of <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>so Bp Lowth; but the Creek is a fairly
good rendering, cf. ἐξέθρεψα, xxiii. 4, Ezek. xxxi. 4, though it does not
correspond elsewhere to <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="5"><p>3. Cf. Jerem. viii. 7.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="6"><p>4. σπέρμα πονηρὸν] The phrase recurs in Heb. and Gr., xiv. 20
(not elsewhere).</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="7"><p>ἐγκατελείπετε, read by AQ, is probably intended for the aorist
(itacism).</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="8"><p>LXX. omits ‘they are gone away backward’: some cursives, mainly
Lucianic and Q mg, supply the words from Aquila's version.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="9"><p>5. ‘Every head, every heart’: so the Greek, and Vulg.
caput, omne cor.’ The Heb. has no article, and opinions vary between
‘every’ and ‘the whole,’ which Ewald, Lowth, Kay, Skinner, c.
with A.V. (and R.V. text). Cheyne compares with the verse
Jerem. xvii. 9, Gen. viii. 21. εἰς before πόνον corresponds to Heb.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="10"><p>Kay construed the ﬁrst part of the verse, ‘Wherefore will ye be
still smitten, that ye revolt yet more?’ which is not far from the mac.
rendering.</p>

<pb n="106"/>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="11"><p>6. The construction is broken; the negatives appear to be cumulative:
‘from feet to head, neither (to) wound, nor scar, nor inflamed
hurt, is there any means to apply ... c.’ Most of the cursive MSS. (but
not 26 49 106 144 301 ; 48 marks with an asterisk) supply the words
οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ ὁλοκληρία from Aquila, agreeing with the Hebrew;
this however makes οὔτε before τραῦμα, μώλωψ, and πληγὴ no easier.
For ὁλοκληρία, cf. Acts iii. 16. The word does not occur again in the
LXX., but the adjective ὁλόκληρος is found, Lev. xxiii. 15, c.; in
N.T. James i. 4, 1 Thess. v. 23.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="12"><p>With this verse compare Ps. xxxviii. 7. Lowth compares Euripides,
Herc. Fur. 1245,
<lg><l>γέμω κακῶν δὴ, κοὐκέτ᾿ ἔσθ’ ὅπου τεθῇ,</l></lg>
and Ovid, Epist. 11. vii. 41, 42
<lg><l>“Sic ego continuo Fortunae vulneror ictu,</l>
<l>Vixque habet in nobis iam nova plaga locum.’</l></lg></p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="13"><p>8. ὀπωροφυλάκιον] Cf. xxiv. 20. Some temporary watching-place,
lonely and frail. Cf. “as melancholy as a lodge in a warren,”
Much Ado, Act II. Sc. i. 221. Here first occurs the mention of a
vineyard; an idea worked out in chap. v., and recalled in chap. xxvii.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="14"><p>The Heb. in Ps. lxxix. 1 is different.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="15"><p>9. mm. omits ‘very small,’ <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>also rendered ‘almost,’ or, as
Ps. lxxxi. 14, ‘soon.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="16"><p>σπέρμα] ‘remnant,’ A.V. and R.V. ; but not the same Heb. word as
in vii. 3 (Shear-jashub), x. 21. The present word may be seen in
Deut. ii. 34 (ζωγρείαν), Josh. x. 20 διασωζόμενοι διεσώθησαν), and
ii. 32, where LXX. has εὐαγγελιζόμενοι. It is however rendered σπέρμα
in Deut. iii. 3. This verse is quoted, Rom. ix. 29, according to the
LXX. For the comparison to Sodom and Gomorrah, see Ezek. xvi. 46
Jerem. xxiii. 14, Matt. xi. 23, Luke x. 12, Jude 7.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="17"><p>10. προσέχετε] Same Heb. word as that rendered by ἐνωτίζου,
ver. 2.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="18"><p>νόμος in the Lxx. regularly represents Heb. torah, meaning ‘direction’
or ‘instruction,’ and applied to the Mosaic ‘Law.’</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="19"><p>11. The prophets constantly urge, by rebuke and otherwise, the
importance of spiritual and practical religion above, and even against,
mere ceremonies. Cf. xxix. 13, lviii. 2—6, lxvi. 3 : Joel ii. 13, Amos
21—24, Micah vi. 6—8, Jerem. vii. 3—6, Zech. vii. 510
and esp. Hosea vi. 6, quoted Matt. ix. 13, xii. 7.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="20"><p>12, 13. The Lxx. coincides in words, but not in syntax or divisions
of clauses, with the Heb.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="21"><p>προσθήσεσθε] προστίθημι, in act. or mid., is used constantly in the

<pb n="107"/>
LXX. to represent the Heb. word for ‘add’ <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>as in the name
Joseph), used almost as an auxiliary to express the repeating or
increase of the verbal action. ‘He added to speak’ = ‘he spoke again.
See, for instance, ver. 5 above, viii. 5, Gen. xxxvii. 8, 1 Kings xix. 2
Hosea i. 6, Amos v. 2.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="22"><p>13. σεμίδαλιν] Heb. minchah, often rendered in A.V. ‘meat-
(R.V. ‘meal-’) offerings, Levit. ii. 1, c. Of Jacob's ‘presents,’ Gen.
13, xliii. 11 δῶρα, δῶρον, as in lxvi. 20; but lxvi. 3 as here). It
seems best to supply ἐὰν φέρητε again before θυμίαμα.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="23"><p>νηστοία A solemn fast, perhaps esp. of the Day of Atonement,
Acts xxvii. 9; ἀργία, Sabbatical (here hypocritical) doing of no work.
Lxx. differs from Heb., and Lowth suggested that they read <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘fast,
for <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘iniquity.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="24"><p>14. ἀνήσω. The meaning of the word seems to be to ‘let go’
whether favourably, to remit, let off; or unfavourably, to abandon, as
in v.6. Kay compares Rom. iii. 25, πάρεσιν ἀμαρτημάτων; see also
Eph. vi. 9, and Heb. xiii. 5, cf. Deut. xxxi. 6, 8.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="25"><p>The Heb. however has, ‘1 am weary of bearing] <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>; and it seems
possible that the real reading is ἀνοίσω (read by 62 147), and perhaps
so also in ii. 9, xlvi. 4; as <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>seems not to be represented by this
verb, except in the future. Cf. also Gen. xviii. 24, Josh. xxiv. 19.
(Jam non sustineo, Hilary, in Psal. ii. § 19. Migne, tom. 9, col. 272.)</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="26"><p>16. παύσασθε...(17) μάθετε καλὸν ποιεῖν] The Greek clauses correspond
less exactly than the Heb.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="27"><p>ἀπὸ ταῖν ψυχαῖν] Govett (Isaiah Unfulfilled) suggested that LXX.'s
reading was <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign><foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>for <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘of your doings.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="28"><p>17. κρίνειν with dat. is hardly classical or usual Greek; it seems
to suggest the interest of the orphans in receiving justice. Also in Ps.
X. 13 (ix. 39) κρῖναι ὀρφανῷ καὶ ταπεινῷ, and below, ver. 23.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="29"><p>χήραν] So most MSS.; iustificate viduam, Cyp. Test. i. 24, iii. 113
Iren.-lat. IV. xvii. 1 and Lucifer. B*Q* 144 147* read χήρᾳ, and so
Clem. Rom. 15;). Car. viii. one MS. Perh. assimilated to preceding
clause.</p>
</div>

is wrong’: or with middle force, ‘let us reason the matter out.’
the Hebrew. Q* reads διελέγχωμεν, perhaps dropping a letter by
accident: but Cyp. Test. i. 24 has disputemus. Cf. xliii. 26, κριθῶμεν,
where Heb. is also different.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="31"><p>καὶ δᾶν] Best taken separately, as in ver. 19; ‘and if,’
‘although.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="32"><p>φοινικοῦν...κόκκινον...λευκανῶ] Cf. Ps. li. 7. If scarlet or crimson

is not elsewhere used (see Skinner's note on this verse) to suggest
sin, ver. 15, ‘full of blood,’ accounts for it here. At any rate, the
intense colour contrasts with the white robes of purity. See Rev.
xvii. 4: but there is one Blood which whitens (Rev. vii. 14).</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="33"><p>ἔριον] Cf. Dan. vii. 9. Wool was most carefully bleached in
ancient times, and so forms a parallel to snow: Virg. Georg. III. 391
“munere niveo lanae’</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="34"><p>19. ἐὰν θέλητε] Cf. Matt. xxiii. 37, ποσάκις ἠθελήσα...καὶ οὐκ
ἠθελήσατε
φάγεσθε] φάγομαι is constantly used as a future form in LXX., and
in N.T., as Luke xiv. 15.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="35"><p>21. Σιὼν] Not in the Heb.; perhaps added here from ver. 26.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="36"><p>ἐν ἦ...ἐν αὐτῇ] An imitation of the usual relative construction in
Hebrew, which does not however occur here. See Introd. to vol. 1.
‘Methods of Rendering,’ p. 41.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="37"><p>22. ἀδόκιμον] Not bearing a test, rejected by it ; a paraphrase of
the Heb. Compare Jerem. vi. 30, Ezek. xxii. 18 foll. The Greek
word is often used by St Paul, Rom. i. 28, c. (‘reprobate’), I Cor.
ix. 27, and in Heb. vi. 8; in the LXX., Prov. xxv. 4.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="38"><p>A repeats a clause here, obviously from ver. 7 ; forming a complete
line of the MS.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="39"><p>oἱ κάπηλοί σου] Not in the Heb., and the syntax necessarily differs.
The word might mean generally ‘traders,’ ‘hucksters,’ or more particularly
‘wine-merchants,’ ‘tavern-keepers.’ “Caupones,” Iren. (lat)
Adv. Haer. IV. xii. 1 ; with the comment, “ostendens quod austero Dei
praecepto miscerent aquatam traditionem.” Cf. Aesch. Agam.

‘mutilated’; according to Alexander, who compares Martial, Ep. 1.
xix. 5, “scelus est iugulare Falernum.’</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="40"><p>23. προσέχοντες] Cf. ver. 10. Originally προσέχειν νοῦν, followed
by dative. Lat. animum advertere seems to have run a nearly similar
course. The Heb. is paraphrased.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="41"><p>24. δεσπότης] Apparently used here, iii. 1, and x. 33, to render
Heb. Adan, a title used, according to Kay, of God “as Supreme
Administrator and Judge,” It occurs also Exod. xxiii. 17, xxxiv.
Mal. iii. 1, and Isai. x. 16, xix. 4. Notice Jerem. xxii. 18.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="42"><p>σαβαὼθ] LXX. transliterates this word in Isaiah and in I Sam.,
renders by δυνάμεων in Psalms, as xxiv. 10, lix. 5, lxix. 6, and a few
other passages, as 2 Sam. vi. 18; generally by παντοκράτωρ elsewhere,
as Jerem. v. 14, Amos iv. 13, v. 15, ix. 15, Micah iv. 4, c. In
xlvi. (xxvi.) 10, AQ insert, in Zech. xiii. 2 they omit σαβαώθ, against

the application ; and so I understand the notes of Bp Lowth and
Alexander. See Cheyne's Comm., vol. I. p. II.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="67"><p>2—4. Opinions differ as to these verses, as to whether they
original here, or in Micah iv. 1—3, or copied by both prophets from
earlier source. Many authorities think them more naturally placed in
Micah, as regards sequence of thought: “the passage ﬁts naturally
into its context” (Sinker); “in any case they are not original in
Isaiah” (Delitzsch). On the other hand, Micah appears to have been
a younger contemporary of Isaiah, and Mic. iii., iv. to date from the
time of Hezekiah; whereas Isa. ii.—iv. are placed by practically
authorities not later than the beginning of Ahaz’ reign. The
that both prophets borrowed from an earlier source is adopted by
many critics as a way out of the dilemma; or else that the passage
“was assigned by some collectors to Isaiah and by others to Micah”
(Prof. A. B. Davidson, in the Temple ample Bible). Other passages are
found, common to two prophets; in which case decision is difficult, but
there is a tendency, if one prophet uses the words as a sort of starting-
point, to suppose them original in the other; see, for instance, Joel iii. 16
and Amos i. 2. But the adapter of the words would be likely to take
some care in placing them; as Micah may have done, see Prof. Cheyne,
ad loan; and many commentators, later as well as earlier, think they
detect likeness to the style of Isaiah here. Isaiah's transitions, moreover,
are frequently and markedly abrupt. On the whole, his claim to
the original authorship has scarcely been disproved.</p>

Heb. word twice, with differences. The MSS. of the LXX. agree in reading
δήσωμεν δήσομεν Ζ): so Jerome on this passage gives alligemus, and
Barnabas, Ep. vi. 7, supports it. But Clement of Alexandria, Strom.
v. 14, and Hegesippus, quoted in Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. 11. xxiii. 15
have presuably presumably rendering from root <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>Justin
Tryph. 17, 133, has δήσωμεν, but in 136, 137 he has ἄρωμεν twice, and
moreover says that δήσωμεν is the Jewish reading. Tertullian also,
Adv. Mare. iii. 22, has Venite, ’nquz’unt, auferamus iustum quid
inutilis est nobis. There is a certain neatness about the Greek; and
the alternative reading supports the syntax and the D: but the
Hebrew has the parallelism in its favour, and the Creek is perhaps
inconsistent with καθ’ ἑαυτῶν.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="128"><p>δύσχρηστος] seems to have more force than the inutilis of
Tertullian, which would be merely ἄχρηστος, as in Hosea viii. 8 ; compare
also Wisd. xiii. 10 and 12 and ii. 11 with ii. 12. It is an
unusually pointed phrase for the 1.101., implying ‘his goodness is no
good, is ill to us’; appearing to adapt the Hebrew of this passage,
‘(it is) good,’ with some skill.</p>

the Greek of Isaiah (as well as for a Hebrew original of Wisdom,
prior to Isaiah himself). The view usually held as to the Book of
Wisdom is however against this. There are many passages in Wisdom
with resemblances to the Lxx. of Isaiah and of other books of the

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="277"><p>Liddell and Scott give for κατανύσσομαι νύσσω, ‘prick’) the meanings
(i) be sorely pricked, (ii) be stupefied, slumber: “in latter senses,
perhaps corrupted from κατανυστάζω.” Bengel on Acts ii. 37 quotes
the Vulgate ’ sunt, and on Rom. xi. 8, which quotes Isai.
xxix. 10, “κατάνυξις notat πάθος ex frequentissima punctione in stuporem
desinens.” The Heb. verb (or verbs)=(i) be silent, amazed, (ii) be
ruined. Consequently the Heb. and Greek words approach one
another only in the meanings of ‘stupefaction’ and ‘silence.’ Vulg.
has (and here: which Prof. Skinner, on this passage, in Camb. Bible
for 55110013, calls an impossible rendering; but it is hardly certain that
this is so of the Greek, even if it be of the Hebrew; for it is quite
possible that LXX. may have so interpreted the original; and it seems
as easy a sense as any to assign to κατανένυγμαι. The force of the
expression seems to have some similarity to Jerem. i. 6, ‘I cannot

it is not so much backwardness as overwhelming surprise and sense

<pb n="134"/>
of unworthiness. If we take the other meaning,‘I am pricked'
might possibly be for ‘I am sore stricken,’ with a reference to the idea
that a sight of God heralded death: see Judg. vi. 22, xiii. 22, Exod.
xxxiii. 20, Deut. v. 24, 26, and Gen. xxxii. 30; which is the earliest

Isaiah's experience shows that the work of an apostle or prophet, to
whom the secrets of God are revealed—see Amos iii. 7—has a sweet
and a bitter side. His lips are purified; but he will not be believed.
Yet with Isaiah, more than any other, except St John, the exaltation
of spirit remains dominant; we see no sign, after this, of his confidence
failing. Jeremiah, by nature, seems to stand at the other end of the
scale of temperament; near him, perhaps, Thomas, Hosea, Micah,

literal representation of the Hebrew, here the “converted” perfect,
equivalent to the imperfect or future. The Greek translator may, it
is true, have felt καὶ to have some such force as is expressed in English

the grammatical points may depend on terminations of which the

may affect the construction, but mainly in the tendency to use aor. and
fut. indicative. Still, irregularities in the use of ἂν especially as to its
omission with subj., are not very conspicuous. Despite the suspicion
caused by A's irregular placing of ὅταν, it may be right to read it

here, an alternative would be to read ἐσαλεύθη. supposing ε to have
dropped out between a preceding and following σε the syllabic augment
does not seem to be omitted. (The reading ἀρθῇ in xviii. 3 is not
certain.) The argument that irregularities of grammar occurring in
the MSS. are likely to be genuine is largely balanced by the consideration
that the grammar of the earlier writers would probably have been

about as many, with minor variations, support NA in the text: I"
simply τῷ μεμεθυσμένῳ; Β τῷ μεμισθωμένῳ, with Heb.; so Theod.
Symm., but Aquila μεμεθυσμένῳ. The main question is between these
two participles; the Heb. means ‘hired,’ decidedly: though, by a
curious coincidence, had it been read as from <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>instead of ΑΒBREVE
it would have been taken to mean ‘drunken.’ The exact, form used
is not found in the case of <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>E but this is probably not conclusive; it
does not occur elsewhere from the other verb. The reading of A seems
preferable, as being the result of a misreading of the Hebrew, whereas
the correct reading may have come in from Theod. and Symm.
(Syro-hex. margin with A, text with B). The converse misreading
occurs at xxviii. I, 3, and a similar case of resemblance both in Gr.
and Heb. at xiv. 21. Of course the correct rendering of B would be
preferable, if the other could be accounted for in that case. It seems
almost possible, indeed, that both readings may have existed from the
ﬁrst, as alternatives; in which case τῷ μεγάλῳ may have been inserted
when μεμισθωμένῳ was displaced, from a sense that something was
missing: though the Hebrew has nothing answering to it.</p>

lightly the land of Zabulon and land of N aphtali, so (lit. and) in the
time to come he treated heavily (i.e. honourably) the way by the sea,
&amp;c.’ The idea of drinking is thus foreign to the original, as well
to the context; and such passages as chap. li. 17, 22, Jer. xxv. 15
27, 28 (xxxii. I, 13, 14 in Lxx.), Ps. 1x. 3, lxxv. 8, do not help: nor
does Habak. ii. 16, though the same words are used in the anti-
thesis of ‘shame’ and ‘honour,’ and the chapter seems full of Isaianic
language. πίε, indeed—though practically all documents support it,

fairly evident corruption), facito” ”—is well-nigh hopeless. It
be best to compare the Greek, word by word, with the literal rendering

difficulty. I suspect that οἱ λοιποί, though looking like an attempt at
rendering ‘(time) to come,’ is an addition of the Greek, and κατοικοῦντες
also superfluous: οἱ τὴν παράλιον (κατοικοῦντες) and ὁδὸν θαλάσσης,
which is given by Aq. Theod., being in fact duplicate renderings. Apart
from this, we have words corresponding to all the Hebrew except ‘he
treated heavily,’ and to all the Greek except πίε. This Hebrew word,
‘heavy,’ <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign> has the secondary meanings of ‘sullen,’ ‘grievous,’ on
the one hand, and ‘grave,’ ’honourable,’ on the other. Now παχὺς
corresponds nearly to some of these meanings: see Aeschylus, Suplices,
618, πόλιν παχῦναι, Septem c. Theb. 771 ὄλβος ἄγαν παχυνθείς;
and note, chap. vi. 10, where ἐπαχύνθη is used of the heart, and ABBREV in a
parallel clause, of the ears. (παχὺς and παχύνειν are not found in the
O.T. as rendering words from root <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign> but they render <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign> ‘bear a
load,’ as Eccl. xii. 5 (in Hithpael, ‘become a burden’) παχυνθῇ ἡ
ἀκρίς, Ps. cxliv. I4 οἱ βόες αὐτῶν παχεῖς. And <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>is rendered by κῦδος,

later versions, due to the Hexapla: for it does not agree with any of

and Clement of Alexandria (Paed. l. 24) quotes it in the form θαυμ
συμβ. θεὸς δυναστὴς πατὴρ αἰώνιος· ὄρχων εἰρήνης, where δυναστὴς
suggests remembrance both of ἐξουσιαστὴς and of the later ’
δυνατός. Irenaeus also (Adv. Haer. IV. 33. II), as preserved in the
Latin version, has Admirabilis consiliarius Deus lortis; and θεὸς is
not in Aq. Symm. Theod. The simplest explanation seems to be,
that an alternative text of the LXX., of which Theodotion, followed
probably by Symmachus, made use, has here left traces, which have
been preserved side by side with the other, which in the present state
of our evidence we must call the true Lxx. That this latter is inferior,
viewed as a faithful rendering of the Heb., need cause no surprise, as
the true mm. of Daniel is commonly agreed to be inferior to the
version which Theodotion chose for his revision: naturally he would
choose the best available. The relation to Aquila's version is, however,
hardly clear.</p>

mainly Hesychian evidence: also by Q, except that it has φόβος in

hypothesis, ὤμου might stand for it; in that case, ‘shoulder’ is the
word omitted, and the ζυγὸς of <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>&amp;c. is in its right place

Heb. and Greek into exact correspondence. Scholz gives the words

Cheyne, in his critical note, The Prophecies of Isaiah, ed. 3, Vol. II.

renderings, and the better one is καὶ καταφθαρήσεται ὁ ζυγὸς ἀπὸ τοῦ

seems to present the facts with complete accuracy: for if the LXX
contains any superfluous words, they must have taken the place of
others that are now lost: but in fact there is nothing certainly added
or duplicated. The text here and in xiv. 25 may have been confused:

Heb. Syntax, § 65 c, Driver, Heb. Tenses, ed. 1, § 64. These passages

the present verse. On the other hand, in Numb. xxii. 4, Heb. nifin.

while in Isai. xxi. 1 the Optative is certainly read. On the whole,
therefore, the infin. seems possible here: but the passages coming
nearest in shade of meaning are either uncertain, or favour the
Optative. In PS. lxiii. 5, ὡσεὶ στέατος καὶ πιότητος ἐμπλησθείη ἡ ψυχή

even after the exile, Ezra vi. 22: just as Horace calls the Parthians

and there remains the difference that Tyconius agrees with
the Heb. in reading et voco eos (=και καλω αυτους) where the Greek
has καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτοὺς (the cursive 301 has ἐγὼ συντάσσω καὶ ἐγὼ καλῶ
αὐτοὺς ἡγιασμένοι εἰσὶν). He thinks that B* omitted ἡγιασμ. εἰσὶν as
awkward, and that β2 is an attempt to emend β by α: unless, indeed β
came by homoeoteleuton from β2: “ but in that case it is very difficult
to explain how β2 ever came into existence. It does not commend
itself as an original, or as a translation, and it does not appear in any
text earlier than the Hexapla.” Agreeing that (α) is the best reading,
and the nearest to the original LXX., I suggest that the process of
corruption was this: καὶ ἐγὼ ἄγω was originally καὶ ἐγὼ καλῶ or καὶ
καλῶ: this bhecame καγωκαγω (or καικαγω), and then καὶ ἐγὼν ἄγω.
ἡγιασμένοι εἰσὶ was then dropped out, and when it was replaced, καὶ
ἐγὼ ἄγω αὐτοὺς was written before it as well as after, some confusing
having arisen, and the corruption from καλῶ to  ἄγω having induced

The Hebrew is Chesil, the identification being at least exceedingly

such passages as Lam. ii. 15 foll., Ezek. xxvi. 17 foll., xxxii. 18 foll.,
and almost the whole of xxvii. There seems to have been a tendency
in other languages to employ the metres of elegy for satiric purposes:
Horace's epodes, the Archilochian metres which he borrows, Martial's
epigrams, the γνῶμαι of Theognis, and some of Propertius' poems, are
instances, in varying degrees.</p>

Many, including A.V., have taken it as connected with <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>the
Aramaic form of <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘gold.’ Delitzsch interprets it from another
root, as 'place place of torture.' Lxx. are generally thought to have read

Most moderns are inclined to follow this reading. ἐπισπουδαστὴς

The relative is probably right, see R.V.</p>

Here the later Greek versions all have πόλεων, which is read by V 109
305 307 308. The evidence of Syro-hex. is divided. Cheyne (following
Hitizig?) wished to read <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘heaps’: Ewald to alter more
considerably to <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘terrible ones.' The resemblance between
‘cities’ and ‘enemies’ in Greek, and the identity of form in Heb., is
curious, but has probably little to do with the real issue. Probably
πολέμων, if not altered or corrupted from πολεμίων, is the real LXX.;
being as near to the original ‘enemies,’ if so rendered, as the translators
might be expected to go. In Ps. lxxiii. 20 Lxx. (and Vulg.)
have the converse difference. See Vol. I. Introd. p. 29. As to the
alternative renderings of the Hebrew, ‘cities’ appears to give the best
sense: building being a favourite occupation of great conquerors,
and almost an inherited tradition of the empire of Babel. See Kay's

its habits are suitable, and a bird seems necessary for the verse

Assyria's fall. From the point of view of those who maintain the
unity of the Book of Isaiah. Delitzsch (ed. 3) explained thus: “Asshur
perishes"... "Only after this had taken place could a prophecy against
Babel, the inheritress of the broken world-power of Assyria, be appropriate.
The two prophecies against Babel and Asshur, therefore,
as they stand here, form a Hysteron proteron." He proceeds to
compare Jer. 1. (xxvii.) 18: Ἰδοὺ ἐγὼ ἐκδικῶ ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα] Βαβυλῶνος
καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν αὐτοῦ καθὼς ἐξεδίκησα ἐπὶ τὸν βασιλέα Ἀσσούρ

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="694"><p>28. It is generally agreed that this verse is the heading to the
passage that follows. The Heb. demonstrative used favours this view
(Davidson, Heb. Syntax, § 4) and such indications of date stand elsewhere
at the beginning rather than the end of a prOphecy. As far as
the Greek is concerned, the LXX. cannot be said to maintain the old
distinction in the use of οὗτος and ὅδε: see ver. 4, τὸν θρῆνον τοῦτον.
Α further question is, whether ‘in the year that king A. died' means
before or after his death. The same difficulty occurs in vi. 1. Kay
thinks after, Cheyne and Delitzsch before. The point is probably
impossible to decide: and the range of time is probably not great;
what seems to be clearly indicated in each case is, that the king's
death, either as imminent, or as recent, was the prominent event in
the mind in connection with the utterance of the prophecy.</p>

somewhat similar conditions.</p>

enemy, because his successor will be more terrible; and the third
more terrible again (unless the ‘ﬁery serpent' is taken as simply
parallel to the ‘viper’). Delitzsch, following the Targum and Jerome,
interprets of the kings of the line of Judah, culminating in the
Messiah: his note should be consulted, to do his view justice; but
the reference to Gen. xlix. 17 and the Danite origin of Samson the
’s great enemy seems beside the mark, and on general grounds
the serpent is the last comparison to the Davidic dynasty that would
be expected. Most modems (Kay, Cheyne, Driver, Skinner, W. E.
Barnes, &amp;c.) take it of Assyrian kings. According to the
as generally accepted as any at the present day, Tiglath-Pileser died
in the same year as Ahaz, or in the year before or after. ‘From the

the state of the case is palpable. It can hardly be doubted that the
Heb. text is right: the tribute of sheep from Moab is referred to,
2 Kings iii. 4. Moab is now advised to return to its old allegiance.
It is doubtful whether the fugitives, in the following verses, are those
of Judah or Israel, forced over the border into Moab, or Moabites,
themselves in distress: some ’are ambiguous, both in Heb.
and Greek: Moab afforded a refuge to Elimelech, Ruth i. I, and to
David's family, I Sam. xxii. 3, 4: but the prophecy seems to be concerned
with the fate of Moab, exclusively: and most modern authorities
take this view. Possibly, therefore, the text-translation of ver. 4a,
and that in the footnote, Vol. I. p. 125, should exchange places: but
the question remains very uncertain.</p>

the sense ‘be not led away' (captive). The readings ἀχθεσθείς, 62 147

ἀχθέω; ἐπειχθῇς, 41 306, might possibly be the true reading, but seems
quite as likely to be a mixture of A's and B's texts. The Syrohexaplar
version gives in its text, according to Field, the equivalent of
μὴ ἀχθεσθῇς, in the margin that of μὴ ταραχθῇς, each of them fairly
reasonable attempts to get sense. A's reading is puzzling: it may be
(a) a corruption from ἀπαχθῇς, or some other verb : (b) ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς, an
additional phrase of the Lxx., which has turned out the verb from the
clause, owing to its being itself mistaken for a verb: it is not easy,
however, to account for its presence in this character : (c) from ἀπόρχω,
‘rule afar off,' almost=rule in exile. Pind. Nem. IV. 76, ἔνθα Τεῦκρος

Ethiopians (see below). The prevailing view, at any rate, is that
Ethiopia is called upon, not to unite her forces, or join with Judah,

ha-tzedek, ‘of righteousness,' quite unlike the Heb. (though see

suggested that the original text was heres, referring to HeliOpolis:
which might have been altered by Jews in Egypt to tzedek, in support
of the Leontopolis temple, by others to heres, ‘destruction,’ in condemnation
of it. This, however, is somewhat complicated; and
Bp ’s sturdy comment is worth recalling: “After all, I believe,
that neither Onias, nor Heliopolis, nor Leontopolis, has anything to
do with this subject" and Prof. Skinner, whose note should be carefully

given by Q, with which the Syro-hexaplar agrees: thinking that the
fuller reading, which duplicates the reading of Q in verbal accordance
with Aq. Theod. Symm. and with the Hebrew, is Hexaplaric. (See
Vol. 1. Introd. p. 31.) Β's last clause is pretty clearly inconsistent with
the rest of its reading, and points to some confusion or inadvertence
on the part of the scribe, who seems to have had both readings before
him. ℵ has been repeatedly corrected: its original text agrees very
nearly with the Heb. A combines, practically, the readings of Q and
of ℵ*. The evidence of the Syro-hexaplar, and the intrinsic character
of ’s text, a terse paraphrase, makes it almost certain that the view of
Field and Ceriani is right. ’s view, that the sentence as given

due account of the textual problem of the LXX.)</p>

xxxviii. 13, LXX. renders by Καρχηδών, Καρχηδόνιοι. Authorities
generally agree that Tarshish is Tartessus, in Spain. (See Herod. 1.
163, IV. 152, 192 ; the meaning of ἀκήρατον is unfortunately doubtful in
W. 152.) Kay refers to Humboldt, Cosmos, 11. pp. 167, 413. It might
be thought that the 1.101. tradition was entitled to carry weight, and
the importance of Carthage (though this is a double-edged argument)
in commerce tallies with that which the Bible attributes to Tarshish.
But from Ezek. xxvii. it appears that Lxx. speak without certainty on
the point; in Isaiah we have such an anachronism as τὰ διαφανῆ
Λακωνικά, iii. 16, and such a guess as Περσῶν, xlix. 12. Cf. Καππαδοκία

Lxx. has the usual Θαρσεῖς, it is generally supposed that <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>is not
a proper name, but stands for some gem, perhaps topaz.) As against
the claims of Carthage, moreover, is the date of its foundation, which
is not placed earlier than the ninth century B.C., so that it could not
have been the Tarshish of ’s day, to say nothing of Gen. x. 4.
The implied distance of the voyage is also, if anything, in favour of

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1224"><p>XXVII. Though hitherto in this section there has been little
specific mention of the surrounding nations, it is evident that they are
symbolically referred to here. The questions are, how many creatures
are spoken of, and, according to the number, which nations they
represent. If one, it is most likely Egypt : if two, Assyria and Egypt:
if three, Assyria-Babylon (Leviathan under two aspects), and Egypt.
From the LXX. it would perhaps be thought that only one was spoken
of: but the Hebrew suggests two, at any rate, and this idea is
strengthened by a comparison of Ezek., esp. xvii. and xxxi., and by
the consideration of ’s position between two greater powers.
Then Ezek. xxiii. tends to show that Babylon may be regarded as a
renewed and modified form of the Assyrian power, and the double
description of Leviathan is thus accounted for. Delitzsch explains
the ‘ﬂeeing’ or ‘ﬂeet’ serpent as emblematic of Nineveh on the
“arrowy ” and the ‘coiled’ or ‘crooked’ of Babylon on the
winding Euphrates.</p>

regard this omission as a clerical error. On the other hand, the next
clause, beginning ver. 18, μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ, gives some support to B's text,
if it can be translated. The use of μή, in this case, appears to be
elliptic (Goodwin, Gr. Μ. and T. § 46, Note 4) cf. Plat. Gorgia:
462 E, μὴ ἀγροικότερον ἦ τὸ ἀληθὲς εἰπεῖν, or Aristotle, EM. Nic. Χ. ix.
6, ὁ δὲ λόγος καὶ ἡ διδαχὴ μή ποτ’ οὐκ ἐν ἅπασιν ἰσχύῃ. See also the
Textus Receptus of Rom. xi. 21. The difficulty is, that in these and
similar passages, the ellipse amounts in practice to a qualified and
cautious assertion, whereas here the assertion seems to be of full
strength : and μὴ καὶ ἀφέλῃ is not necessarily the same construction as
the previous clause. The Lxx. has certainly broken loose to some
extent from the Heb., and the construction is rather broken: and μὴ
καὶ ἀφέλῃ certainly seems to mean, ‘see lest it take ’ Either
then, ὅτι οὐ μὴ παρέλθῃ may explain ψεύδεα ‘ye who vainly trust in
a lying idea that the tempest will not pass over you, see that it take
not away...and (certainly) your hope will not ’ This involves
taking παρέλθῃ as practically equivalent to ἐπέλθῃ, which is not free
from objection, though see ver. 15, 19. The only other course,
apparently, is to take the words ὅτι οὐ μὴ. . . ἐμείνῃ as a simple
parenthesis: ‘for the tempest shall not pass you by: take heed lest
it even take away your covenant of death, and, &amp;c.’ It is
possible, that if ὅτι οὐ μὴ is the true text, the scribe of B or ’s

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1351"><p>φάγεσθε γὰρ σὺν Μωάβ] This strange phrase bears no resemblance
to Heb., except the connection between Φαγέσθε and ‘feasts.’ The
Luc. MSS. supply a Hexaplaric rendering, ἑορταὶ συγκρουσθήσονται
and the LXX. text doubtless professes to translate these same words.
The Old Latin is here extant in the VViirzburg fragment, beginning
with the words manducate ’tz’: ’m cum Μοab. This sup-
ports ’s text which repeats φάγεσθε; so also does ’s rendering
of the Lxx.: and it is noteworthy that both treat the ﬁrst φάγεσθε as
imperative. Of this imperat. middle there are some possible instances
elsewhere in Lxx., e.g. xxxvii. 30, but perhaps none which are certainly
imperative.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1352"><p>As to σὺν Μωάβ, there are two questions. What is the meaning or
reference? Is it the original Lxx. text? To the ﬁrst, several attempts
at an answer might be made, but none certain or convincing. It might
be a reference to ’s parents, sojourning for safety in Moab;
1 Sam. xxii. 3; or to Elimelech and his family, taking refuge there
from famine: Ruth i. I: or generally, in reference to these and other
possible episodes (cf. xvi. 3, 4), meaning ‘you shall be reduced to seek
food at ’s ’ But there is nothing to show what the
translator, or the ﬁrst writer, of these words intended.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1353"><p>Secondly, is the Greek text right? The error, if there be one, is
clearly shown to be old, by the O.L. and the agreement of the MSS.,
except as regards φάγεσθε. Yet this evidence does not exclude early
corruption: and σὺν Μωὰβ is unintelligible, especially as a duplicate

<pb n="247"/>
of συνκρουσθήσονται. Can some such adjective as συμβωμὰ have been
corrupted? ‘ye shall eat ’ might not be too remote for a
paraphrase or guess, and as βωμὸς is not the usual Lxx. word for
‘altar,’ the unusual word would be prone to disappear. (In Isaiah
βωμὸς occurs only in xv. 2, xvi. 12, xvii. 8, xxvii. 9.)</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1354"><p>2. ἡ ἰσχὺς καὶ τὸ πλοῦτος] Heb. ‘lamentation and ’ which
Lxx has certainly mistaken in some way; perhaps mom for men,

is omitted, except ‘to me': probably by confusion of the two occurrences

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1372"><p>9. Shortened and paraphrased in Lxx. Heb. begins the verse
with two pairs of verbs, the first of each a reflexive form, and either
from the same root, or one connected with the second verb, or else used
with a play on words and different meaning: the former alternative
seems the more likely: ‘Astonish yourselves, and be astonished: blind
yourselves, and be ’ (otherwise (most probably) ‘Tarry, and be
astonished: take your pleasure, and be blind!'), Vulg. has ’te,
εἰ ’ramz’m’, ﬂuctuate, et uacillate.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1373"><p>It seems that Lxx. have attempted to translate the first pair only:
the second being supplied, with variants, by the Luc. MSS. from the

resembles the treatment of a similarly obscure pair of verbs in
Zeph. ii. 1, συνάχθητε καὶ συνδέθητε, Vulg. conuenite, congregamini

verbs here as cognate pairs.</p>

asterisk, as in Aq. Theod. Symm. Mr- Burkitt shows that Tyconius,
constructing ἐγγίζει with τοῖς χείλεσιν, could not have read the additional
words: labiis adpropihquet, cord: autem long: separatus sit. So the
Wurzb. Fragm., adpropiat mihi plebs haec labiis suis honorant me cor

text, and Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Cor. xv. 2) Irenaeus (IV. xii. 4) and
Clement of Alexandria (Paed. 1. 76) are at any rate not against it.
In fact, the shorter text, as ’ven by RAQ, may be regarded as pretty
certainly right for the Lxx.; though, as Mr Burkitt again points out,
some confusion appears at ﬁrst sight in estimating the evidence of the
Fathers, because it is sometimes doubtful whether they are not quoting
from the Gospels: where, in Matthew, most MSS., headed by CΔΦ
have the longer text, though RBDL 33 have the shorter, which the

principal editors (and RV.) approve: in Mark the evidence is all
for the shorter form, and indeed for the further omission of ἐγγίζει

might be omitted in quotations (as by St Cyprian), under the inﬂuence
of the Gospels, must certainly stand in Isaiah.</p>

there is no resemblance in the Heb. of the two passages. Here the
Heb. is obscure: but there is general agreement among modems,
that Rahab is a name applied to Egypt, meaning ‘arrogance’ or the
like; Ii. 9, Ps. lxxxvii. 4, lxxxix. lo ὑπερήφανον). But Rallab seems
also to have stood for a sea-monster, Job ix. I3, xxvi. 12 τὸ κῆτος);
and it appears thus in parallelism to stand for the sea itself. As the
monster, perhaps, cf. xxvii. I, it stands for Egypt : the great unwieldy
river power, Ezek. xxix. 3.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1430"><p>This however brings us no nearer to the Lxx. rendering: ματαιότητας

as <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>: αὕτη is out of its order, but in a sentence like this the Greek
might have been arranged: while ‘sitting still’ would seem to have
been transferred to the next verse, καθίσας, and ‘go,' ’ which seemed to
contradict it, disappeared, or was rendered as merely hortatory by οὖν.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1431"><p>The Syriac (Peshitta) has here ‘uain is this your confidence' (see

usually put for ‘the day of the Lord,' or ‘In that day,’ though see
xviii. 7 : and in viii. 22 it may have been similarly meant; there is a
sense of crisis ἦ ἀπορίη ἔχει καιρόν τινά, Aristotle, Metaph. VII. iii. 7).
The Hebrew here has not this meaning, but merely ‘an after day,
used generally. B with Luc. MSS. reads καιρῷ, placing it after ταῦτα,

with <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>by εἷς αἰῶνα; but their accuracy is scarcely to be trusted, as
these Heb. words occur in very varied combinations. As some Luc.

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1438"><p>11. ἀποστρέψατε. . .ἀφέλετε. . .ἀφέλετε] Heb. has two former verbs

Lord. Comparing Levit. xvi. 3, 16, 33 with 1 Kings vi. 5 c., vii. 49
the ‘Holy of ’ of the Tabernacle had, corresponding to it in
’s Temple, the ‘oracle’ ‘31, differing by and pointing from
a ῾word.᾿ LXX. in Kings transliterate, δαβὶρ or δαβείρ. In this case,
the drift, according to LXX., differs from Heb. ‘This’ ‘this path,:

support of this, is not perceptibly nearer to it in meaning. The sense

Of course no king of Assyria met his end at this Tophet, so far as is

the word ‘towers’ being literally ‘a thing raised up,’ and the verb

Theod. ἐξέθρεψα for it. Consequently it seems that συντρεφομένους
is the original of A's reading, though even then the preposition is
hard to account for. This, on a wrong idea of the intended meaning,

Lxx. however must have known that the <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>is only the pronominal

supposing the Greek “Wisdom of Solomon” to have preceded
Greek Isaiah, says (Line: of Defence of the Bibl. Revelation, p. 17)
“It would seem that the jingle of the Hebrew word in Isaiah with the
Greek word used in Wisdom was what suggested this inaccurate but
elegant rendering.” There certainly seems to be some affinity
the Greek of Wisdom and Isaiah: see on iii. 10, and xliv. 20: but the
difficulties seem rather increased than diminishedtby supposing
Wisdom to be the earlier. On the whole, Scholz's view, which in

deny Isaiah's authorship of chh. xl.—lxvi. On the whole it will
found (whether there be any necessary connection between views held
on these two questions, or no) that these deny also his authorship of
xxxvi.—xxxix., and hold that the parallel passages in 2 Kings,
17—xx. 19, are there found in their original place and form; while
supporters of the traditional view, that Isaiah is the author, substantially,
of all the sixty-six chapters of the book bearing his name, make no
exception here, and consider that the compiler of Kings borrowed from
Isaiah. Thus Kay says, “These two chapters (viz., xxxvi., xxxvii.)...
are the historical goal of chh. vii.—xxxv. The two following
on the other hand, are the historical starting-point of chh. xl.—lxvi.’

better and more authentic,” warns us not to draw a hasty
from this, as “in the relation of Jer. Iii. to 2 Kings xxiv. 18—xxv.
have a proof that the text of a piece may be preserved more faithfully
in the secondary place than in the original.” He gives several
for thinking the passage original in Isaiah:
<lg><l>i) That the author of Kings had Isaiah's book before him, as<lb/>
shown by comparing 2 Kings xvi. 5 with Isai. vii. 1.</l>
<l>(ii) The reference in 2 Chron., as above.</l>
<l>(iii) That the Chronicler knows Isaiah as a historian of Uzziah's<lb/>
reign (2 Chron. xxvi. 22).</l>
<l>(iv) That the style is prophetic in character, and worthy of<lb/>
Isaiah.</l>
<l>(v) That Isaiah elsewhere incorporates historical memoranda,<lb/>
speaking sometimes in the ﬁrst, sometimes in the third<lb/>

character by a tendency towards abridgement and simplification
and in other respects shews ‘manifest traces of having passed through
the hands of the compiler of Kings.”’ These words he quotes
Prof. Driver, who points out that “2 Kings xviii. 14—16 are not
Isaiah, and are derived from a different source from that which has
been followed by the compiler in the ensuing prophetical narrative.’
He holds that I sai. xxxvi.—xxxix. “are probably in their more
place in the Book of Kings, whence they were excerpted (with a few
slight abridgments and alterations, and with one addition, viz. the
Song of Hezekiah)”...“The superior originality of 2 Kings xx. 4

says, “Hitherto the copy of this history in the Second Book of Kings
has been the most correct: in this chapter, that in Isaiah has the
advantage.’</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1748"><p>Prof. W. E. Barnes says of xxxvi., xxxvii., “These chapters correspond

of the Annals of Judah.” (And similarly of xxxviii. 1—8, 21, 22.)</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1749"><p>On the whole, no hypothesis is free from difficulties. Probably it is a
mistake to try to decide the question in the light of general theories as
to the composition of the Book of Isaiah. The view that the original
source of these chapters is to be sought in Isaiah seems rather the
simpler.</p>
</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="1750"><p>On turning to the Septuagint, the verbal differences between Kings
and Isaiah will be found considerable; exceeding the differences in
the Hebrew, as though independently translated; following, however,
as a rule, differences of the Heb. text; and the version in Kings
generally closer than that in Isaiah. Hence, in some cases, when the
Heb. is identical in Kings and Isaiah, it may happen that the mm. of
Kings is closer than the Lxx. of Isaiah to the Hebrew of Isaiah.
See, for instance,
<lg><l>2 Kings xviii. 34 = Isai. xxxvi. 19.</l>
<l>2 Kings xx. 7 = Isai. xxxviii. 21.</l></lg></p>

a few resemblances to the wording in Isaiah are found in Α, the
influence of Aquila being perceptible. Thus the Lxx. of Kings
in A, and of Isaiah in B, come nearest to one another among the
principal uncials: being in each case, it would seem, less pure than
their rivals. Conversely, ’s Kings and ’s Isaiah show wider
divergence.</p>

Isaiah's work. Nor, it may be noticed, does the author of Ecclesiasticus.
The ﬁrst doubt on the subject seems to have been expressed
by lbn Ezra in the twelfth century A.D.; and not again until the
eighteenth century, when the modern views were put forward by
the German school of whom Gesenius, Hitzig and Ewald are the chief
names. These views are probably held, in one form or another, by a
majority of the authorities and students of the present day. It is per-
haps therefore proper for the writer of these notes to state that he is
not convinced by them, but holds that, substantially, the whole of the

Heb. and Lxx. here is well known, and the quotation, Matt. xii. 18 foll.,
complicates matters more. In the first place, Heb. has no mention
here of ‘jacob’ and ‘Istael.’ Scholz supports Lxx. here, holding that
the M.T. has been altered, and that LXX. have “die schwierigere, und
darum kritisch gesicherte Lesart”: but probably few will agree
him. The names might easily have come in from other passages, as
xli. 8, xliv. I, 2; whereas their omission from Heb. would be difficult
to explain, as it would be an unlikely accident, and in view of other
passages, a futile expedient, if intentional. ’s quotation is
here mainly with Heb.; the resemblance to Theodotion's version, to

Greek, IV. pp. 199 foIl., with special reference to the quotations in
Justin, Dial. Tryph. 123, 135. These agree with Lxx. in inserting
Ἰακώβ, Ἰσραήλ, and in some other respects, while varying generally
between Lxx. and the text as given in ’s quotation. In estimating
the evidence of Patristic quotations of the passage, the question
must be taken into account, whether they quote from Isaiah or Mat.

Praxean, who is decidedly against LXX.; Accipe igitur et alias

</div>
<div type="textpart" subtype="paragraph" n="2017"><p>The conclusion seems to be, with regard to the main quotation:
(a) that LXX. are wrong in inserting Ἰακώβ...Ἰσραήλ: (b) that Matthew
quoted either loosely from Heb. and Lxx. alternately, or from an older
form of Lxx., which Theodotion may have used. (This is more likely
than an alternative Hebrew: but ’s source may have been a
loosely put together collection of prophecies): (c) that later quotations
of the passage are likely to be confused, either originally or in transcrition
from the three main sources, Isai. Heb., Isai. Lxx., and
Matthew.</p>

Matthew might conceivably have dropped into Habakkuk's wording.

ambiguity. Calvin, Vitringa, Henderson, Alexander, Knobel, Gesenius,

scarcely valid if we suppose it to have been an error in the first place,

even as to their reading. Moreover, ἀδικουμένων is used to render

continues (torccularis) pleni et conculcati, while Tertullian has sicut dc

This evidence seems to converge in favour of reading πλήρους
καταπεπατημένης, and carrying down the sentence to that point. The
evidence for πλήρης however is very strong: and it is possible that
whereas a genitive seems preferable, πλήρης may be taken as indeclinable.
See Hort, Introd. to NT. in Greek, Appendix, p. 24, on
Mark iv. 28, where he suggests that πλήρης is to be read, as indeclin able,
there and in Acts vi. 5 (where A has it also in ver. 3). So Γ reads
πλήρης in 1. 15, and B in Ii. 20; cf. A, in 2 Kings vi. 17. If then
we place the stop after καταπεπατημένης, and regard πλήρης as genit.,
the resulting sentence is no doubt incoherent and ill-balanced. But
this is not decisive against it, and the evidence is considerable that
it was so taken in ancient times.</p>

by Arabic analogy, to be a parallel word to ‘breast,’ ‘teat’ or
‘udder’: others have taken it in the sense of ‘universality.’ Delitzsch
discredits these views, and explains it as ‘fulness to the brim,’ from
root meaning motion. ‘Abundance’ seems to give the general sense.

‘one’ being the officiating hierophant, followed by the worshippers,
or surrounded by them: “in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the
son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand.” (Some
tried to find the name of a heathen deity in the words, but this is
hardly satisfactory.) If the Heb. margin be taken, ‘one’ is feminine,
<foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>,. which is interpreted as meaning one ‘tree’ or êrah, in the
midst of the garden. The phrase ‘behind one,’ <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign><foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>is
to produce confusion: some have suggested reading <foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign><foreign xml:lang="abbr">ABBREV</foreign>‘one

name of the Assyrian king in 2 Kings xv. 19 (Margoliouth) or a

(b) their spelling of proper names is often untrustworthy, not least in
the Prophets: Pul himself appears in 2 Kings as Kings as θουά: θοὺδ is
almost as much in favour of Pul as of Put, Δ and A being liable to
confusion.</p>

Phthians, Epeians, and, of course, the Athenians.” On the
