<head>ISAIAH</head>
<p>FROM HEBREW</p>
<p>I. 1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw
concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz, (and) Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p>2 Hear, Ο heavens, and give ear, Ο earth: for the LORD hath
spoken, I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have
rebelled against me.</p>
<p>3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his ’s crib:
Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>
<p>4 Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
evildoers, sons that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the LORD,
they have scorned the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away
backward.</p>
<p>5 Why will ye be still stricken, (that) ye revolt more and more?
the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p>6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head (there is) no
soundness in it; wound, and weal, and putrefying sore: they
have not been pressed out, neither bound up, neither is it
mollified with oil.</p>
<p>7 Your country is a desolation, your cities are burned with
ﬁre; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is a
desolation, like an overthrow of strangers.</p>
<p>8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as
a ’tent in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<note type="footnote">2. ‘nourished and brought up,’ cf. ch. xxiii. 4. Or, ‘made great and set
on high.’ Cf. Ezek. xxxi.</note>
<note type="footnote">4 ﬁn. Lit. ‘they are estranged backward’: ‘abalienati sunt
Vulg. Cf. xlii. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. ‘revolt more and more,’ Heb. ‘add revolt.’ ‘the whole,’
head...every heart,’ as the Greek.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ‘tent,’ or, ‘hut.’ Cf. xxiv. 20</note>

<p>I. x The vision which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw, which
he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the reign of Uzziah,
Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, who ’over Judah.</p>
<p>2 Hear, O heaven, and give ear, earth; for the Lord hath
spoken, I have begotten sons and upraised them, but they have
set me at nought.</p>
<p>3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his ’s crib:
but Israel knoweth me not, and the people understandeth me not.</p>
<p>4 Ah, sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless
sons: ye have forsaken the Lord, and angered the Holy One of
Israel.</p>
<p>5 Why should ye be yet smitten, (for) transgressing further?
every head (turns) to weariness, and every heart to grief.</p>
<p>6 From the feet to the head, neither wound, nor stripe, nor
inflamed hurt: there is no means to apply a balm, or oil, or
bandages.</p>
<p>7 Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with ﬁre; your
country, strangers devour it before your face, and it has been
desolated, ruined by stranger peoples.</p>
<p>8 The daughter of Zion shall be left like a booth in avineyard,
and like a watching-hut in a cucumber garden, like a city
besieged.</p>
<note type="footnote">1. Or, ‘against Judah and Jer.’ Matt. v. n, Acts vi. 13 &amp;c</note>
<note type="footnote">5. ‘transgressing further’: lit. ‘adding’</note>
<note type="footnote">6. After ‘head’ several cursives supply (from Aquila’s version) ‘there
no soundness (completeness, cf. Acts iii. 16) in it.’ In the true Lxx. text,
negatives seem to be cumulative, and the construction broken (casus pendens);
sense being, ‘neither to wound nor stripe can one c.’</note>

<p>9 Except the LORD of Hosts had left us a very small remnant,
we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto
Gomorrah.</p>
<p>10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ye
ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p>11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto
me? saith the LORD: I am sated with the burnt offerings of rams,
and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</p>
<p>12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this
at your hand, to trample my courts?</p>
<p>13 Bring no more vain (meal-) offerings; incense is an abomination
unto me; new moons and sabbaths, callings of assemblies;
I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meetings.</p>
<p>14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:
they are a cumbrance unto me: I am weary of bearing.</p>
<p>15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you; yea, when ye multiply prayer, I will not hear; your
hands are full of blood.</p>
<p>16 Wash you, make you clean; remove the evil of your doings
from before mine eyes; cease to do evil,</p>
<p>17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, correct the oppressore
judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p>18 Come now, and let us confer together, saith the LORD;
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow:
though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p>19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
land:</p>
<p>20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be eaten (by) the sword
for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<note type="footnote">9. Or (but ‘a remnant, almost as Sodom should we
have been’ &amp;</note>

<p>9 And unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed there, we
should have become as Sodom, and we should have been made
like as Gomorrah.</p>
<p>10 Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; attend ye
to the law of God, people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p>11 What is the abundance of your sacrifices to me? saith the
Lord: I am full of burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of lambs,
and the blood of bulls and of goats I desire not,</p>
<p>12 Not even if ye come to appear before me. For who hath
demanded this of your hands? Tread my court</p>
<p>13 Ye shall not, any more; if ye bring me ﬁne ﬂour, it is vain;
incense, it is an abomination to me; your new moons, and the
sabbaths, and a great day, I cannot bear: fasting and idleness,</p>
<p>14 And your new moons, and your feasts, my soul hateth;
ye are become to me a surfeit! no longer will I let your sins be.</p>
<p>15 When ye stretch out your hands toward me, I will turn away
mine eyes from you; and if ye multiply your petition, I will not
listen to you; for your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p>16 Wash you, become clean; take away your wickednesses
from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your wickednesses,</p>
<p>17 Learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver one wronged,
judge for the orphan, justify the widow.</p>
<p>18 And ’come, and let us be convicted, saith the Lord; and if
your sins be as a scarlet thing, I will make them white as snow;
and if they be as crimson, I will make them white as wool.</p>
<p>19 And if ye be willing, and hearken unto me, ye shall eat the
good things of the land:</p>
<p>20 But if ye be not willing, neither hearken unto me, a sword ’
shall devour you; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.</p>

<p>21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! she (that) was
full of judgment, righteousness lodged in her; but now murderers:</p>
<p>22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine impaired with water:</p>
<p>23 Thy princes (are) rebellious, and companions of thieves:
every one of them loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they
judge not the fatherless, ’doth the cause of the widow
come unto them.</p>
<p>24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the
mighty one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and
avenge me of mine enemies.</p>
<p>25 And I will bring back mine hand upon thee, and purge
away as (with) lye thy dross, and take away all thine alloy:</p>
<p>26 And I will restore thy judges as at the ﬁrst, and thy
counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called
Citadel of righteousness, faithful city.</p>
<p>27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts
with righteousness.</p>
<p>28 And (there shall be) a shattering of the rebels and of the
sinners together, and they that forsake the LORD shall come to an
end.</p>
<p>29 For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have
desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
chosen.</p>
<p>30 For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf withereth, and as
a garden that hath no water.</p>
<p>31 And the strong shall become as tow, and his work as a
spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench
them.</p>

<p>21 How is the faithful city Zion become a harlot! (once)
full of judgment, and in her righteousness did rest; but now
murderers.</p>
<p>22 Your silver is base; thy hucksters mix the wine with water:</p>
<p>23 Thy rulers are disobedient; companions of thieves, that
love gifts, that pursue a recompense; that judge not for orphans,
and attend not to the cause of a widow.</p>
<p>24 Therefore thus saith the Ruler, the Lord of Hosts, Ah, the
strong ones of Israel! for my wrath shall not cease upon mine
adversaries, and I will exact judgment from mine enemies.</p>
<p>25 And I will turn mine band upon thee, and burn thee into
purity, and the disobedient will I destroy, and take away all
transgressors from thee, and will humble all arrogant ones.</p>
<p>26 And I will set up thy judges as in former time, and thy
counsellors as from the beginning; and after that thou shalt be
called City of righteousness, faithful mother-city Zion.</p>
<p>27 For with judgment shall her captivity be saved, and with
mercy.</p>
<p>28 And the transgressors and the sinners together shall be
broken in pieces, and they that forsake the Lord shall be brought to an end.
to an end.</p>
<p>29 For they shall be ashamed for their idols, which themselves
desired, and shall be ashamed for their gardens, which they longed for.</p>
<p>30 For they shall be as a terebinth that hath cast off its leaves,
and as a park with no water.</p>
<p>31 And their strength shall be as a stalk of ﬂax, and their
works as sparks of ﬁre, and the transgressors and the sinners
shall be burned up together, and there shall be none that shall
quench them.</p>

<p>II. 1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning
Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2 And it shall come to pass in the end of the days, the mountain
of the ’S house shall be established in the top of the
mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all nations
shall ﬂow unto it.</p>
<p>3 And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go
up tothe mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the
LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>4 And he shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for
many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
<p>5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of
the LORD.</p>
<p>6 For thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob,
because they be replenished from the East, and are soothsayers
like the Philistines, and strike hands with the children of aliens.</p>
<p>7 And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any
end of their treasures; and their land is full of horses, neither is
there any end of their chariots:</p>
<p>8 And their land is full of false gods: they worship the work
of their own hands, that which their own ﬁngers have made:</p>
<p>9 And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is
brought low; and forgive them not.</p>

<p>II. I The word that came from the Lord to Isaiah the son
of Amoz concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem</p>
<p>2 For in the last days shall the mountain of the Lord be
clearly seen, and the house of God upon the top of the mountains,
and it shall be uplifted above the hills, and all the nations shall
come unto it.</p>
<p>3 And many nations shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up
into the mountain of the Lord, and into the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will proclaim to us his way, and we will walk in it.
For out of Zion shall a law come forth, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>4 And he shall judge between the nations, and shall convince
much people; and they shall beat their Swords into ploughshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks; and nation shall not any
more take a sword against nation, and they shall not learn to war
any more.</p>
<p>5 And now, Ο house of Jacob, come, let us walk by the light
of the Lord.</p>
<p>6 For he hath given up his people, the house of Israel; because
their country is ﬁlled with omens, as at the ﬁrst, like the land of
the Strangers, and many strange children are born to them.</p>
<p>7 For their country is ﬁlled with silver and gold, and there
is no number to their treasures; and their land is ﬁlled with
horses, and there is no number to their chariots:</p>
<p>8 And the land is ﬁlled with abominations, the works of their
hands, and they worship things which their own ﬁngers have
made:</p>

<p>10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before
the fear of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty.</p>
<p>11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
exalted in that day.</p>
<p>12 For the LORD of Hosts hath a day upon every one that is
proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and he
shall be brought low:</p>
<p>13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up,
and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</p>

haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall

<p>19 And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the

Lord alone shall be uplifted in that day.</p>
<p>12 For there is a day of the Lord of Hosts against every
worker of pride, and overweening one, and against every one that
is high and lofty, and they shall be humbled:</p>
<p>13 And against every cedar of Lebanon, of them that are high
and lofty, and against every oak-tree of Bashan,</p>
<p>14 And against every mountain, and against every high
hill,</p>
<p>15 And against every high tower, and against every high
wall,</p>

of the beauty of ships:</p>
<p>17 And every man shall be humbled. and the uplifting of men

rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the fear of the
Lord, and from the glory of his strength, when he ariseth to

silver and the golden, which he made to worship, to the vain ones

tripping along they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</p>
<p>17 Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the-crown of the

against them, and will. scatter their enemies,</p>

them that devour Israel with open mouth. For all this

Zion they wander, from small to great they wander (on) to the

I give one that bringeth good tidings.</p>
<p>28 And I saw, and there was no man; and among these, and
there was no counsellor, that I should ask of them, and they
should answer a word.</p>
<p>29 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are ’;

shall he not quench; according to truth shall he bring forth
judgment.</p>
<p>4 He shall not burn dimly nor be bruised, till he (shall) set
judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.</p>
<p>5 Thus saith the God, the LORD, he that created the heavens,
and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and the
things that come forth of it; that giveth breath unto the people
upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</p>
<p>6 Ι the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will take
hold of thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
of the people, for -a light of the nations:</p>
<p>7 To open blind eyes, to bring out a captivefrom prison, and
them that sit in darkness from a house of confinement</p>
<p>8 Iam the Lord; that is my name; and my glory will I not

their idols there was none that declared (aught), and if I ask of
them, Whence are ye? they will not answer me.</p>
<p>29 For they are those that make you, and vain are they that
lead you astray.</p>
<p>XLII. 1 Jacob my servant, on him will I take hold;
Israel (is) my chosen, my soul hath received him; I have put my
spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment for the nations.</p>
<p>2 He shall not cry out, nor send forth (his voice), nor shall his
voice be heard without.</p>
<p>3 A bruised reed shall he not crush, and smoking ﬂax shall he
not quench, but shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</p>
<p>4. He shall shine out, and shall not be shattered, until he have

ﬁxed it, who established the earth and the things therein, and
grave breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread
thereon,</p>
<p>6 Ι the Lord God have called thee in righteousness, and will
hold fast thine hand, and will strengthen thee, and have given
I thee for a covenant of a race, for a light of nations.</p>

are bound, and men that sit in darkness out of a prison house.</p>

a spoil, and there is none that delivereth; a prey, and none that
saith, Restore.</p>
<p>23 Who among you will give ear to this? will hearken, and

the snare is in treasuries everywhere, and in houses together;
where they hid themselves, they became a prey; and there was
none that set free a prey, and there was none that said, Restore.</p>
<p>23 Who is there among you that will give ear to this? he shall
