Anaximander of Miletus, disciple of Thales, ﬁrst attempted to draw the
 earth on a map. After him Hecataeus of Miletus, a widely- traveled man,
 improved the work marvelously. Hellanicus of Lesbos, a man of much
 learning, gave his account without a map. Then Damastes of Citium wrote
 a circumnavigation, drawing mostly on Hecataeus. Next Democritus and
 Eudoxus and others wrote tours of the earth by land and sea.

The ancients drew the earth round, and regarded Hellas as the center and
 Delphi as the center of Hellas, since it had the navel of the earth.
 Democritus, a man of much experience, ﬁrst perceived that the earth was
 oblong, with the length half again the breadth. Dicaearchus the
 Peripatetic agreed with him. Eudoxus made the length double the breadth,
 Eratosthenes more than double, Crates semicircular, Hipparchus
 trapezoid, others . . . , Posidonius the Stoic sling-shaped and wide in
 the middle from south to north, narrow to the east and west, wider,
 however, to the southeast, toward India.

Boundaries of the continents: of Europe and Libya the Pillars of
 Hercules; of Libya and Asia the Nile, but some say the isthmus between
 Lake Serbonis and the Arabian gulf; of Asia and Europe the ancients said
 the Phasis River and the isthmus to the Caspian, the later and more
 recent ones say Lake Maeotis and the Tanais River.

The continents were called ἤπειροι as being 
 boundless (ἄπειροι) , out of
 ignorance. Asia was named for coming close
 (ἆσσον) for those going over
 from Europe both by land and by the islands lying in a row: Euboea
 Andros Tenos Myconos Icaria Samos Mycale. Europe was named for its
 breadth (εὖρος) . Libya was quite unknown to the Greeks,
 but from a
 signal nation †Phoenicians were named seafaring†. The ocean was named
 for quickly encircling (ὠκέως ἀνύειν) the earth.

Dicaearchus bounds the earth not by waters but by a straight line from
 the Pillars through Sardinia Sicily Peloponnesus Ionia Caria Lycia
 Pamphylia Cilicia and Taurus on to Mt Imaus, and he calls the several
 regions either northern or southern.

The winds blow: from equinoctial sunrise apeliotes , 
 from equinoctial
 sunset zephyros from midday notos , 
 from the bear aparctias , 
 
 from summer
 solstice (sunrise) kaikias , and next, from equinoctial sunrise
 apeliotes , and from winter sunrise euros ,
 and in the west, from winter
 sunset lips , 
 and next again, from equinoctial sunset zephyros 
 from
 summer sunset argestes 
 or Olympias also called Iapyx , 
 then notos and
 aparctias blowing opposite each other; so there are eight.

But Timosthenes, who wrote the circumnavigations, says there are twelve,
 adding boreas between aparctias 
 and kaikias , phoinix also called
 euronotos between euros 
 and notos , leuconotos 
 or libonotos between notos 
 and lips , thrascias 
 or kirkios (as called by the local people) between
 aparctias and argestes . 
 He says nations dwell on the borders of the
 earth, towards apeliotes Bactrians, 
 towards euros Indians, towards
 phoinix the Red Sea and Aethiopia, towards 
 notos Aethiopia beyond Egypt,
 towards leuconotos Garamantes
 beyond the Syrtes, towards lips western
 Aethiopians beyond Moors, towards zephyos 
 the Pillars and the beginnings
 of Libya and Europe, towards argestes 
 Iberia, now Hispania, towards
 thrascias 
 Celts and their neighbors, towards aparctias 
 Scythians beyond
 Thrace, towards borras 
 Pontus Maeotis Sarmatians, towards kaikias the
 Caspian Sea and Sacae.

The Great Syrtis is 5000 stades, the Little Syrtis 1600 stades. The mouth
 of the Adriatic, which some call the Ionian Sea, has a passage of 700
 stades from the tip of Iapygia to the Ceraunian mountains in Epirus.

After the Aegean Sea comes the Hellespont ending at Abydus and Sestus,
 then the Propontis ending at Chalcedon and Byzantium, where the narrows
 are from which the Pontus begins, then Lake Maeotis. Again, from the
 beginning of Europe and Libya the Iberian Sea from the Pillars to Mt
 Pyrene, the Ligurian as far as the borders of Etruria, the Sardinian
 beyond Sardinia bending down towards Libya, the Tuscan ending as far as
 Sicily and beginning from the capes of Liguria, then the Libyan, then
 the Cretan and Sicilian and Ionian and Adriatic and the one opening out
 of the Sicilian sea, which they call the gulf of Corinth or Halcyon sea.

 Icarian, in which are the Cyclades, then the Carpathian and Pamphylian
 and Egyptian. Beyond the Icarian spreads the Aegean.

Finally, we will give the perimeters of the islands of our earth taking
 them from Artemidorus and Menippus and other trustworthy authors. Gades
 is 120 stades long, 16 wide; the passage at the Pillars of Hercules is
 80 stades at the narrowest; in the Iberian sea, of the Pityussae islands
 the greater, inhabited, is 300 stades long, the lesser 100 stades; of
 the Gymnasiae, which the Carthaginians call Baliariae (for slingers are
 thus called Baliares) the greater is 1200 stades long, 400 stades wide,
 the lesser 300 stades. The Stoechades so-called lie in a row in front of
 the Massilian towns, three greater and two small near Massilia itself.
 Sardinia has the shape of a footprint, hollow in the middle, 2200 long;
 Corsica near Sardinia but much poorer is less than half as long as
 Sardinia; the take-off for Sardinia and Corsica is Popu 
 lonium in
 Etruria, the passage 1200 stades. The perimeter of Sicily according to
 Timosthenes is 4740 stades, the shape a scalene triangle, the passage
 from Cape Pelorus to Italy 12 stades. The side of the island from
 Pelorus to Pachynum is 1360 stades, from Pachynum to Lilybaeum 1600
 stades, from Lilybaeum to Pelorias according to Timosthenes 1700 stades;
 the passage from Lilybaeum to Aspis in Libya about 1500 stades.

The island Cercina is 200 long, 70 stades wide, but 40 at the narrowest;
 it lies off the town Theёne on the mainland at the beginning of the
 lesser Syrtis; beside Cercina lies the island Carcinitis, joined by a
 bridge, 40 stades long, 25 stades wide.

From Cercina to the island Meninx Lotophagitis the passage is 600 stades,
 as is said to be the mouth of the lesser Syrtis; Meninx is 600 stades
 long, 180 stades wide, and there are great currents around it.

The island Cephallenia, of four towns, is 400 stades long. There are also
 in the Adriatic islands along Illyria, especially Issa and Black Corcyra
 and Pharos and Melite, of which I do not know the perimeters.

The circumnavigation of the Peloponnesus counting the gulfs is 5627
 stades, without entering the gulfs 4000 stades; the length from Malea to
 Aegium is 1400 stades; the shape like a plane leaf, cut up by great
 gulfs; it narrows in the Gulf of Corinth to the Isthmus 40 stades wide
 between the Corinthian and Saronic gulfs.
 
 
 
 to Cape Scyllaeum with
 the island Calauria to the left sacred to Poseidon, then the gulf of
 Hermione, next the gulf of Argos as far as Cape Malea, which juts far
 into the sea, next after Malea the gulf of Laconia as far as Taenarum on
 the right, which bounds the gulf of Messenia on the left with Cape
 Acritas on the right, then Cape Ichthys, off which is Zacynthus, and
 Cape Chelonatas, and ﬁnally Cape Araxus facing Acarnania, after which
 opens up the Gulf of Corinth narrowing to a mouth of 7 stades at Rhion
 in the Peloponnesus and Antirhion in Locris. From Taenarum to Phycus in
 Libya the passage is 3000 stades.

The island Aegina 160 stades long lies against Attica; Salamis 70 stades
 long, Ceia 120. Of the Cyclades the greatest is Naxos, hence called
 Little Sicily; to the right are the Sporades. Euboea is joined to
 Boeotia by a bridge; it extends along Boeotia Phocis Locris, and on the
 other end even a little along Attica, for it is long, hence called
 Macris, the length 1700 stades.

Crete is near the Peloponnesus off Malea, 4100 stades around, 2300 long,
 for it is much lengthened; Cythera is between Crete and Laconia. Cyprus
 has the shape of a hide, perimeter 3420 stades, length 1300; from Paphos
 to Alexandria the passage is from 
 the north, 3800 stades. The perimeter
 of Rhodes is 1300 stades, of Cos 540 stades, of Samos 630 stades. Icaria
 is long and rugged, the length 300 stades. The perimeter of Chios is 660
 stades, of Lesbos 1100 stades.
