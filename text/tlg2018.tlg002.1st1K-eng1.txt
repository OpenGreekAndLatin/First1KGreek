THE text of the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius in
 the following pages is that of E. Schwartz in volumes
 i and ii. of Part II. of the edition of Eusebius in
 Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der erstern
 drei Gahrhunderte, published by the Berlin Academy.
 Changes have only been introduced in a few very
 small points, such as the accentuation of the proper
 names in the genealogy of Christ.

I am most grateful to the Academy for its kindness
 in allowing me the use of this magnificent
 example of how a text ought to be edited.

In preparing the English I have in difficult passages
 frequently consulted the translation of A.C.M‘Giffert
 and have derived much benefit from his notes. I
 am also greatly indebted to my friends Mrs.
 Frederick Winslow, Professor Robert P. Blake, who
 read proof-sheets and suggested many improvements,
 and Miss Edith Coe, who helped at every stage,
 and undertook the laborious work of verifying and
 inserting the references which were taken from
 Schwartz.
