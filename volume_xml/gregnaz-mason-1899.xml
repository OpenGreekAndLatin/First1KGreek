<head>PREFATORY NOTE.</head>
<p>THE Syndics of the Cambridge University Press
have arranged for the issue of a series of Patristic
Texts for Theological Students, of which the present
volume is the first instalment. Other volumes are in
course of preparation.</p>
<p>The series will include not only complete treatises,
but also parts of larger works, which will be treated as
complete in themselves, and selections of letters and
sermons. The present book may be taken as a sample
of the size of the volumes.</p>
<p>The object is to give to Theological Students the
same kind of assistance in reading Patristic works,
which is so abundantly given to students of the Classical
authors. Regard will be had to the needs of those who
have not many books of reference at hand.</p>
<p>The main part of the work in each case will consist
of the actual Text, based on the best editions, with a
collation of MSS. where possible, together with a digest of
important various reeidings, and with explanatory notes.
Brief Introductions will deal with the place of the work

<pb n="vi"/>
in the history of the Christian Church, and give information
with regard to the MSS., editions, and
literature of the subject. Copious Indices will follow,
of Subjects, of Scripture Texts, and of Words.</p>
<p>The Indices to the present volume have been drawn
up by the Rev. W. J. Foxell, M.A., Minor Canon of
Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>Α. J. Μ.</p>
<p>October, 1899.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>I. THE THEOLOGICAL ORATIONS.</p>
<p>The five Orations here presented contain no exact
indication of their date, but there can be no doubt
that they were delivered during the time when their
author was in charge of the Church of Constantinople.
Discourses uttered at Nazianzus or Caesarea would
have been more likely to be coloured by special
allusions than those uttered in the capital, which assume
an universal character. The first of the Orations
appears to reflect the busy and varied life of a great
city, with its theatres and exhibitions, its markets and
its social gatherings. At Constantinople Gregory was
more directly called upon than elsewhere to preach
dogmatic sermons. The very purpose for which he was
summoned to that city was to revive the almost extinct
cause of Catholicism there. We may well believe that
we have in these Orations the supreme effort of Gregory's
public teaching at Constantinople.</p>
<p>Accordingly the date must be in one of the three
years 379 — 381. It was at the end of 378 or early in
379 that Gregory entered Constantinople 1, and he quitted
it during the General Council of 381.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 Tillemont IX note xxiii.</note>

<pb n="x"/>
<p>It is possible, however, to come a little closer. The
twenty-second and twenty-third Orations were certainly
delivered at Constantinople about the middle of the
year 379. At the end of the latter of those two Orations,
Gregory promises to crush the serpent eggs of heresy
by “ a stiff and solid ” There can be little
doubt that he regarded his “ Theological Orations ” as
the fulfilment of this promise. And in Oration XLII,
in which Gregory took leave of Constantinople and the
Council, he speaks of having already carefully dealt with
the Scriptural texts around which the current controversies
raged —a description which would well suit the
Theological Orations, especially the fourth. Everything
therefore points to the correctness of the conclusion
that the Five Orations were delivered — and probably
published in writing — in the year 380.</p>
<p>The first four are directed against the Eunomian
heresy. Eunomius, whom Ullmann describes as “ one
of the most interesting heretics of the fourth century ”
was a Cappadocian, like Gregory himself 2. He had
been a disciple of Aetius, the real successor of Arius
in the leadership of the heresy. Eunomius, who in 360
became Bishop of Cyzicus near Constantinople, infused
an altogether new vigour into the Arian party, though at
the cost of its disruption. He took up boldly the assertion
of Arius, which prudence had allowed to be forgotten,
that the Son of God was so far from being
“of one ” with the Father, that He was not
even “of like ” The Eunomian party assumed
for its rallying cry the word ἀνόμοιος. The more mode-
<note type="footnote">1 Gregorius von Nazianz p. 318.</note>
<note type="footnote">2 Gwatkin Studies of Arianism p. 241 describes Cappadocia as “ the
most Arian province of the ” and gives a list of well-known Arians
who sprang from it.</note>

<pb n="xi"/>
rate Arians, who confessed that our Lord was ὅμοιος
to the Father, were thrown into the arms of the Nicene
school by the excessive zeal with which the Eunomians
pushed their view. Eunomius and his adherents prided
themselves on the strictly logical method of their teaching.
Nothing was allowed to be taken for granted ;
nothing accepted on faith. They taught that God, as
being absolutely simple, must be perfectly comprehensible
to the human intellect. Everything of a mysterious
nature disappeared from their system. They were unwilling
to use any language about God which conveyed
its meaning after a symbolical or metaphorical manner.
Their arguments implied that such terms as “ generation,"
if applicable to Him at all, must be held to
connote that all the circumstances of generation, as
known to the created world, have their counterpart in
the divine life also.</p>
<p>These doctrines they taught with the utmost assiduity.
Gregory, in the third Theological Oration,
shews 1 that they used a regular method of instruction,
with short text-books for beginners, in which the main
arguments were skilfully marshalled in a form which
made them easy to remember. The whole atmosphere
of Constantinople was full of their disputations, pressed
upon all hearers, Christian and not Christian, without
reserve. “ Every ” Gregory says, “ resounds
with their words ; every dinner-party is spoiled by their
ill-bred talkativeness ; as for festivals and funerals, — all
festivity is banished from the one, the other become
cheerful things in comparison with the misfortune of
having to listen to their arguments ; even the women's
apartments, the natural abode of what is simple and
unaffected, are all made wretched, and robbed of the


<pb n="xii"/>
flower of their modesty, by haste to speak. Our ‘ great
mystery ’ is in danger of becoming a matter of mincing
technical terms 1. ”</p>
<p>It was in these circumstances that Gregory intervened.
In his first Oration, he reproved the contentiousness
which he saw around him, letting his censure
fall upon the orthodox as well as upon the Eunomian
party. He shewed what preparation was required both
in the speaker and in the hearer before religious subjects
could be rightly treated of. He laid stress upon the
harm done when the sacred language of Christianity
was dragged out before the heathen, and subjected to
irreverent criticism. He exhorted the disputants to
turn their attention to other subjects of controversy.</p>
<p>In the second Oration, Gregory shewed that the
nature of God is beyond the power of man to understand.
We may assuredly know by the study of the
world around us that God is, but we cannot find out
what He is. We can arrive at negative truths concerning
Him, that He is incorporeal and the like, but
not at any adequate positive conception. We are compelled
to use figurative and anthropomorphic language
concerning Him, and it is hard to recognise constantly
that such language is only figurative. Idolatry is the
result of failure to recognise it. The saints of the Old
Testament, privileged as they were, — nay the Apostles
themselves, — knew God ΟnΙγ in part. Even the works
of God transcend our powers of intelligence and of
wonder ; how much more the God who created them.</p>
<p>The third Oration begins with the statement of our
belief in a God who is One, but in Three Persons.
Gregory shews that such a Sonship as we acknowledge

<pb n="xiii"/>
in the Godhead is not to be interpreted by the phenomena
of carnal generation, and that it implies no priority
of existence on the part of the Father. He deals with
the various questions of a more or less captious nature
raised by the Eunomians, prior to the study of the
Scriptural evidence, such as the following : — Did the
Father beget the Son by an act of will, or not? Did
the Son exist before He was begotten, or not? If the
Son is begotten and the Father unbegotten, how can
They be said to be of the same nature? If the Father
is acknowledged to be greater than the Son, inasmuch
as He is the cause of His being, and if it is His very
nature to be the cause, how is He not greater by nature
than the Son ? Gregory then falls back upon the
authority of Scripture, and shews that the Godhead
of the Son is clearly implied, even where not explicitly
stated, and that the passages which speak of Him in
less exalted terms must be interpreted with reference
to His assumption of our created nature in the Incarnation.
The way of faith is a better way than that of
argument.</p>
<p>In his next Oration Gregory deals seriatim with the
stock texts which Arians adduced against the Godhead
of the Son, applying to them the canon of interpretation
which he had laid down in the fourth. He then discusses
the names by which God is spoken of in Scripture, and
especially those of the Son, both as God and as Man.</p>
<p>The fifth Oration is on the subject of the Holy
Spirit ; and here Gregory is confronted not only by his
Eunomian opponents 1, but by many also of those who
shrank from the language of extreme Arianism concerning
the Son. They were the party known as Mace-
<note type="footnote">1 This accounts for ’s description of these Orations: ’ aduersus
Eunomium liber unus; de Spiritu Sancto liber ’ (Script. Eccl. cxvii).</note>

<pb n="xiv"/>
donians, from a fromer Bishop of Constantinople who
had espoused their views. These men, in their whish to
avoid controvertible terms, objected to teh statement 
that the Holy Ghost is God, on the same ground on
which the insertion of the ὁμοούσιον in the Creed had
been objected to. They said, with some show of reason,
that it was going beyond the words of Scripture. After
dealing with some difficultiesx, raised by the more deter-
mined antagonists of the Catholic doctrine, Gregory
defends himself against the charge of Tritheism which
even more moderate opponents did not hesitate to level
against it, and then proceeds to exmamins the testimony
of Scripture. In an interesting passage, he gives what
he believes to be the reason for the reticence of Scripture
with regard to the deity of the Holy Spirit, shewing that
there is a gradual development of the divine revetation
to suit the advancing capacities of those to whom it is 
given.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Gregory is of course not novel.
Ullman1 rightly declares that his want of originality in
this respect is one of his chief merits. The Orations of
Athanasius against the Arians were, in particular, well
known to him, and he frequently makes use of them,
especially in clearing up objections drawn from Scripture.
He was also familiar with the works of his friends
Basil on the same subjects; though the Theological
Orations owe a more direct debt to Basil's Hexaemeron
than to his more dogmatic compositions. From the 
Hexaemeron Gregory derives much of the fine description
of the wonders of nature which occupies the latter part of
the second Oration.</p>
<p>The exegesis of Holy Scripture was considered in 
his own time to be one of Gregory's strongest points.

<pb n="xv"/>
Jerome speaks of him as ‘ praeceptor meus, a quo Scripturas
turas explanante didici1,’ ‘ Gregorium ’ Nazianzenum,᾿
he says, ‘ et Didymum in Scripturis Sanctis catechistas
habui2.' He speaks of having written a work at Constantinople
‘cum...apud uirum eloquentissimum Gregorium
Nazianzenum, tunc eiusdem urbis episcopum,
sanctarum Scripturarum studiis erudirer 3.' From the
modern point of view, however, Gregory cannot be
said to rank in this respect as high as some of his
contemporaries. He had not the critical instinct of
Basil. Basil, for instance, in arguing upon Prov. viii 22 4,
dwells upon the facts that the expression “ the Lord
created ” if attributed to our Saviour, would stand
alone in Scripture ; that the book in which it occurs is
a book of enigmatical sayings, and not of theological
statements ; that the Hebrew word probably means
“ possessed ” rather than “ created ” ; that “ created ” is
often used in other senses than that which the Eunomians
here affirmed 5, and the like. Gregory, on the other
hand, only discounts to a certain extent the authority of
Solomon, mentions, but to reject it, ’s view that the
speaker in the passage is not the Eternal Word, but a
personification of wisdom 6, and then argues (after Athanasius)
that the creation spoken of is the creation of the
human nature which the Word assumed. There are
other passages where Gregory shews both acumen and
candour in his interpretations ; but he does not often
rise above the exegetical methods of his age.</p>
<p>It is in his lucid expositions of the doctrine of the
Trinity that Gregory chiefly excels. By these it was
<note type="footnote">1 Script. Eccl. cxvii.</note>

<note type="footnote">6 Sec note on iv 2 (p. 110).</note>

<pb n="xvi"/>
that he won the title of “ the ” In simple
and reverent language, without presumptuous over-defi-nition,
he enuntiates the traditional belief, as championed
by Athanasius, in a way which became the law for
future theologians. Sentence after sentence from Gregory
is incorporated in the de Orthodoxa Fide of John
of Damascus. Indeed the doctrine of the Trinity could
not be better expressed than in such passages as iii <lb n="2"/>
and v 9 and 10.</p>
<p>There is, however, one point in which Gregory's
teaching requires to be read with caution. If his language
were taken according to its strict grammatical
sense, it might sometimes be pressed to mean that in
the Incarnate Saviour a human person coexisted with
the Eternal Word who had come down into our flesh,
or had in some way been substituted for Him. The
principal passages to which this caution refers are the
following :</p>
<p>iii 18 τὰ μὲν ὑψηλότερα πρόσαγε τῇ θεότητι καὶ τῇ
κρείττονι φύσει παθῶν καὶ σώματος, τὰ δὲ ταπεινότερα τῷ
συνθέτῳ, καὶ τῷ διὰ σὲ κενωθέντι καὶ σαρκωθέντι, οὐδὲν δὲ
χεῖρον εἰπεῖν, καὶ ἀνθρωπισθέντι.</p>
<p>Here indeed the danger is not great. No one could doubt that
ὁ κενωθείς, ὁ ἀνθρωπισθείς, is the same person to whom belongs the
θεότης. But the contrast drawn is not exact. Gr. ought in strictness
to have said τὰ δὲ ταπεινότερα τῇ σαρκί, or τῇ ἀνθρωπότητι, or the like.
The effect of the contrast actually drawn is to suggest that in the
process of incarnation the personality was changed, or that a new
personality was set up. The true doctrine of the unchanged
personality could not, however, be more clearly stated than in
the words which commence the section following.</p>
<p>iii 19 ἄνθρωπος, ὁ κάτω θεός,] συνανεκράθη θεῷ, καὶ
γέγονεν εἷς, τοῦ κρείττονος ἐκνικήσαντος, ἵνα γένωμαι
τοσοῦτον θεός, ὅσον ἐκεῖνος ἄνθρωπος.</p>

<pb n="xvii"/>
<p>Here Gr. must be understood to mean that man, i.e. humanity,
was united to God (i.e. to the Divine Son), and became One
Person with Him. But the absence of an expressed subject to the
verb συνανεκράθη makes it at first appear as if a personal subject
were to be understood “he was united to ”). which would be
false. τοῦ κρείττονος must be taken as neut, not masc, the method
of the union being that the superior nature triumphed over the
inferior. The last phrase has a danger of its own.</p>
<p>iv I τὰς μὲν ὑψηλοτέρας καὶ θεοπρεπεστέρας φωνὰς
προσνείμαντες τῇ θεότητι, τὰς δὲ ταπεινοτέρας καὶ ἀνθρωπικωτέρας
τῷ νέῳ δι’ ἡμᾶς Ἀδὰμ καὶ θεῷ παθητῷ κατὰ
τῆς ἁμαρτίας.</p>
<p>Here, as in iii 18, the suggestion is that of a change of perso-
nality in the Incarnation. The phrase suits Gr.'s poetical
and no one could really mistake his meaning.</p>
<p>iv 2 ὧν ἕνεκεν ἐχρίσθη θεότητι· χρίσις γὰρ αὕτη τῆς
ἀνθρωπότητος.</p>
<p>It would, of course, be inexact to speak of our Lord as being
“anointed with ” Probably Gr. intended ἡ ἀνθρωπότης to
be the actual subject of ἐχρίσθη. This would be quite correct.
But as he appears to make that ἀνθρωπότης itself speak, the effect
is to erect the ἀνθρωπότης into a personal subject. The language
implies that His humanity had an existence prior to the anointing,
and that it was in fact the true seat of His personality. The same
is implied in —</p>
<p>iv 3 τί δὲ μεῖζον ἀνθρώπου ταπεινότητι ἢ θεῷ πλακῆναι,
καὶ γενέσθαι θεὸν ἐκ τῆς μίξεως.</p>
<p>iv 7 τὸ γὰρ δὴ λέγειν ὅτι τοῦ κατὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον
νοουμένου μείζων ὁ πατὴρ] ἀληθὲς μέν, οὐ μέγα δέ.
This seems to indicate that “ He who is conceived of in accordance
with the ” (i.e. with the human nature which He assumed) is a
different person from Him who is conceived of in accordance with
the Word, or with God. So in</p>
<p>iv 8 οὐ τοῦ λόγου, τοῦ ὁρωμένου δέ...οὐ τοῦ ὁρωμένου,
τοῦ λόγου δέ.</p>

<pb n="xviii"/>
<p>Here τοῦ ὁρωμένου is evidently masc, and it implies (though Gr.
certainly did not intend it to do so) that ὁ ὁρώμενος is one person,
and ὁ λόγος another.</p>
<p>iv 9 καὶ τοῦτο τῆς ἀνθρωπότητος· εἰ δὲ καὶ τῷ θεῷ
δοίης, οὐκ ἄτοπον.</p>
<p>Whatever is predicated of the humanity of Christ is predicated
of “the God" in Him, for there is no human personality of
it can be predicated. The true contrast would have been to say εἰ
τῇ θεότητι δοίης.</p>
<p>iv IO εἴτε ὁ σωματικῶς ὁρώμενος...εἵτε ὁ ὡς λόγος
νοούμενος.</p>
<p>The presence of the definite articles causes some confusion, as
if “Ηe that was seen in bodily ” were a different person from
“Him that is conceived of as the Word.”</p>
<p>iv 12 εἰ μὲν οὖν μὴ παρὰ τοῦ κατεληλυθότος αὐτοῦ
ταῦτα ἐλέγετο, εἴπομεν ἂν ὡς παρὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τυποῦ-
σθαι τὸν λόγον, οὐ τοῦ κατὰ τὸν σωτῆρα νοουμένου — τὸ
γὰρ ἐκείνου θέλειν οὐδὲ ὑπεναντίον θεῷ, θεωθὲν ὅλον —
ἀλλὰ τοῦ καθ’ ἡμᾶς νοουμένου].</p>
<p>Here, besides the difficulty of the last clause, which makes
ὁ κατὰ τὸν σωτῆρα νοούμενος to appear to be a different person from
ὁ καθ’ ἡμᾶς, we have the contrast between τὸ κατεληλυθός (i.e. the
Godhead, or rather the Divine Person) and ὁ ἄνθρωπος. The
contrast is made all the more marked by the ἐκείνου in the
parenthetical clause, and indeed by the whole of that clause, which
sets “ Him who is conceived of according to the ” and His
“ wholly deified ” will, over against “ the man ” and (it is implied)
“ the ’s ” will which was for the moment in conflict with God's.
It is clear from the context that Gr. did not hold the theory of two
persons in Christ, but only of two natures and two wills ; but the
language is inexact.</p>
<p>iv 13 κατὰ κοινοῦ τῆς θεότητος ἦν ὁ λόγος.</p>
<p>Gr. says that the saying “to know Thee, the only true ” is
addressed by Jesus Christ to “the Godhead in ” including,
that is, the Son Himself. It would be hard to think of Christ

<pb n="xix"/>
addressing words of worship to the Eternal Son without supposing
Christ to be one person and the Eternal Son another.
iv 21 ἧς ἔργον ἄνθρωπον ἀκοῦσαι τὸ χρίον, καὶ ποιῆσαι
θεὸν τὸ χριόμενον.</p>
<p>It is not exactly true to say that “the anointing ” in
Christ comes to be called man. The Blessed Person who may be
said to anoint the humanity which He assumed is rightly called
man, but His divine nature never became man, nor did the human
nature which He “anointed” become God.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that such passages indicate a
want of clearness in ’s conception of the one
person of Christ in two natures. He does indeed, as has
been observed, sometimes state admirably the Catholic
doctrine on the point ; at other times his language thus
wavers. It must be said on ’s behalf that the
same ambiguities are to be found in other Catholic
fathers, — for instance in Athanasius. And Gregory
lived before the rise of the Nestorian heresy, which compelled
the Church to arrive at a more conscious and
definite belief with regard to the unity of Christ's person,
and the impersonality of His human nature apart from
the divine 1.</p>
<p>II. THE TEXT.</p>
<p>The present volume does not profess to offer a complete
critical edition of the Five Orations. According to
our scheme, the texts in the series to which it belongs
are to be based upon the best printed editions, though,
where possible, recourse is to be had to the original MSS.,
and the chief various readings are to be noted.</p>
<note type="footnote">1 The tendency towards Nestorianism in Gr., as in Athanasius like-
wise, is observed by Dorner Person of Christ div. 1 vol. ii p. 384 (Engl.
Transl.).</note>

<pb n="xx"/>
<p>In this case, however, the best printed edition, that is
to say the Benedictine edition (1778 — 1842), proved to
be so unsatisfactory, not only in regard to minor matters,
such as accents and punctuation, but in regard both to
the readings adopted, and to the critical notes, that I
was compelled to form what is practically a fresh text.
For this purpose, on a brief visit to Paris last year,
I made a fresh collation, in part, of the two most important
of the MSS. used by the Benedictines, denoted in the
present edition by the letters “ a ” and “ b ”. Owing to
the shortness of the time at my disposal, I was not able
to make the collation quite complete, — in some parts
only taking note of the evidence of these MSS. in places
where the Benedictine editors indicated that there were
divergences of reading. Ι collated in the same way the
MS. in the Library of Trinity College, Cambridge, here
denoted by the letter “ g ”. which has not been collated
before. Ι further obtained, through the kind offices of
Herr S. Riezler, a complete collation of the Munich MS.
"c ” by the hand of Dr C. Gleye. The MS. has not
used before for any edition of Gregory. From the Rev.
H. Ν. Bate, Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
the Rev. K. Lake, Fellow of Lincoln College, I obtained
complete collations of the various MSS. of any value
preserved at Oxford. The readings of these MSS. had
been to a certain extent recorded by Montagu in the
17th century, but ’s method renders his work
useless for purposes of accurate criticism.</p>
<p>The MSS., therefore, upon which the present text is
based are the following.</p>
<p>a. The Medicean MS. 510 in the Bibliotheque Nationale
at Paris. (Omont i p. 66.) This fine codex is
described in the Benedictine edition Vol. I. p. xi. It
is written in uncial characters, on parchment, with a

<pb n="xxi"/>
number of full-page pictures and well executed initials.
It is denoted in the Benedictine edition by the letters
“ bm ”, which stand for Basil the Macedonian, because it
contains a picture of that Emperor, represented as still
reigning. As Basil died in the year 886, this gives us
approximately the date of the MS. It contains all the
Theological Orations, together with all ’s other
Orations, except that the last few lines of our Or. ii, and
the first five chapters and a half of v, as well as the end
of v, are missing.</p>
<p>b = Coislin LI, in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris
(see ’s BibliotJieca Coisliniana p. 118). It is
a folio MS. of the ioth century, presenting a text markedly
different from that of “a”. In the Benedictine edition
it is “ Coisl. I."</p>
<p>c = Munich Cod. CCCCXLVIII. “ Membranaceus,...in
folio, sine titulis miniatis, litteris minutis et nitidissimis,
cum marginalibus minutissimis alterius manus,...atramento
flavescente, saec. X,...optime conservatus et ”
” (Hardt's Catalogus Codd. mss. Graec. Bibl. Reg.
Bavaricae torn, iv p. 394.) It contains all five Orations.</p>
<p>d. I have used this letter to denote two different
MSS. in the Bodleian Library. The first is Barocc. <lb n="218"/>
which contains, of these Orations, only ii. It is described
in ’s Catalogue as “ Codex membranaceus, in 4to,
saec. xi optime, minuto tamen charactere, ”
The other, which contains the three last, is Barocc. 181 ;
“ Codex membranaceus, in folio, saec. forsan xi, bin is
columnis, optime exaratus.”</p>
<p>e = Magdalen College, Oxford, (Greek) Codex V. — a
parchment MS. in quarto of the nth century ’s
Catalogus Codd. MSS. qui in Collegiis Aulisque Oxon,
adservantur vol. ii p. 3).</p>

<pb n="xx"/>
<p>f = Lincoln College, Oxford, (Greek) Codex XX. — a
parchment folio, “ saec. forsan xi exeuntis ” (Coxe ibid.
vol. i p. 12).</p>
<p>g = Trinity College, Cambridge, B. 9. 13. The book
is lettered on the back as a volume of Chrysostom, but
is really of Gregory. It is one of ’s MSS., brought
from the monastery of Pantocrator on Mount Athos. It
is written in a good clear hand, apparently of the beginning
of the nth century. The first 44 pp. contain our
Orations iii, iv and v.</p>
<p>Many other existing MSS. contain these Orations,
and ought to be examined with a view to obtaining the
proper data for a critical edition. In the Bibliotheque
Nationale alone there are eleven or twelve more MSS. containing
them, besides “ a ” and “ b ”, dating from the 10th
and nth centuries, not to speak of later ones. In the
Vatican there are seven from the same period, besides a
fragment of the vth Oration which is not later than the
9th. These have not been used by any editors, although
the Benedictines profess on their title page to have used
them. The Laurentian Library at Florence contains
two uncollated MSS. of the 10th century, the Library of
the Escorial contains another, in which these Orations, in
whole or in part, appear. Had Ι known how long my
edition would be delayed, Ι should have endeavoured to
obtain collations of at any rate the most important of
these. With regard to the Basel MS., upon which I presume
that the editions of Hervagius and Leuvenklaius
were based, Dr Bernoulli kindly informs me that it is
only of the 13th century.</p>
<p>The de fide Orthodoxa of St John Damascene contains
many passages from these Theological Orations, but

<pb n="xxiii"/>
I have not observed any instance in which that work
throws light upon a doubtful text of Gregory.</p>
<p>The commentaries of Elias of Crete are valuable, not
only from an exegetical point of view, but as shewing
what was the current text of his time. Extracts from
his commentaries, with notes by A. Jahn, are printed in
’s edition of Gregory (Patr. Graec. t. xxxvi).
Jahn has successfully shewn that this Elias is not to be
confounded with his namesake and fellow-countryman
who attended the Second Council of Nicaea A.D. 787
but that he wrote in the middle of the nth century.</p>
<p>The chief printed editions of Gregory's works — there
is no separate edition, so far as I am aware, of the five
Theological Orations — are those of Hervagius of Basel
in 1550, of De Billy (Prunaeus) at Paris in 1569 and
subsequent years accompanied by a Latin translation, of
Leuvenklaius at Basel in 1 571, containing selections
from the commentaries of Elias and others, of Morel at
Paris in 1630, and of the Benedictines of St Maur, of
which the first volume, containing the Orations, was
published in 1778. This last is reprinted in ’s
Patrologia, with the addition of ’s notes upon Elias.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to refer to French and German
translations of Gregory. The scholarship of the only
English translation with which I am acquainted, in
Wace and SchafT Niccne and Post-Niccne Fathers, is
unfortunately far below the level of that of Cyril in the
same volume, and the student will do well to avoid
a work which is only misleading.</p>
<p>In my apparatus criticus I have given in inverted
commas the critical notes of the Benedictine edition,
such as they are. Thus on p. 5, ἐξικνεῖται bd ’Or. 1 ’
means that my own collations shew ἐξικνεῖται to be the
reading of b and d, and that the Benedictine editors say

<pb n="xxiv"/>
that the same is the reading of ‘ Oratoire I ’ and of
other MSS. which they leave unspecified.</p>
<p>When passages in these Orations themselves are
referred to in the notes, they are given simply thus —
ii 21, v 8; or, when another section of the same Oration
is referred to, thus —§ 10. When the reference is to
some other Oration of ’s, the number is given as
in the Benedictine edition, with the word Oration (Or.)
prefixed. Thus “Or. ii ” does not refer to the second
of these five Orations, but to that which stands second
in the Benedictine edition of Gregory's whole works.</p>

Gr. is fond of the partitive gen. (οἱ

it seems best here to suppose
τοῖς ’στ’. to be neut., ’the solid qualities
of our discourses? Perh. Gr. is
still using the metaphor or simile of

<note type="footnote">6. ζημ. καὶ εἰς τ. ἁ. δ.] The εἰς

fails to increase the vital forces of
those to whom it is administered;
it even impairs those which they
possessed. Cp. v 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. It is always right to think of
God; but not always suitable to discourse

<note type="footnote">8. ἐπιφυέσθωσαν] ἐπιφύειν is ’to
plant upon ’ ; hence in pass. ‘to fasten
upon and cling ’ like hounds upon
a quarry. Plutarch frequently uses
the word in this way; e.g. § 1
ἐπιφυομένους, ὥσπερ θηρίοις εὐγενεῖς
σκύλακας. Gr. uses it again in v ιι.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. οἱ π. εὔκολοι] ‘ who are always
(lit. in all points) so agile and ’
ὕκολος (cp. δύσκολος), from κόλον,
’diet,’ means originally one whose
food agrees with him. Hence it
comes to be used for facility in any

upon each. But prob.
Gr. does not concern himself with
the context of the passage, and intends
the ’rebuke’ to apply to the

Gr. requires before so doing (p. 4
supra); but the discipline must have
been hurried through ‘all in a day?’
ib. χειροτονεῖς θ....ἐμπνεῖς τ. π.]
The same thought carried on. These
men’s theology has come to them,
not by long study and careful training,
but by a touch or a breath.
Xειρ. prob. alludes to the act of
laying on of hands in Ordination,
though Gr. does not necessarily
imply that the men had been actually
ordained. The word, however, may
perh. only mean ‘elect?,’ ‘appoint.’
In either case the process is characterized
as both arbitrary and sudden .</note>
<note type="footnote">4. ἐμπνεῖς] Elias supposes a ref.
to such passages as Gen. ii 7 or Job
xxvii 3. If the allusion to ordination
in χειρ. were secure, it would
be natural to connect ἐμπν. with John
xx 22 (ἐνεφύσησεν). There is no
evidence, however, that any ceremony
of breathing was used in Gr.’s
time in ordaining; and it seems
simpler to regard the word as denoting
only a quick and miraculous
way of imparting the knowledge of
divine things.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. π. συνέδρια] So equipped,
the theologians pass to those ‘multitudinous
councils’ which were the
chief feature of Church History in
the fourth century. Gr., as is well
known, had no high opinion of
councils at the best (Stanley Eastern
Church p. 74). Λογίων points both
to the assurance with which these
men spoke, and to the source of their
inspiration (ἐμπνεῖς).</note>
<note type="footnote">6. ἐνδεσμεῖς] a rare word; ‘to

are of course the dogmatic subtleties
by which they entangle weak opponents.
Cp. Orat. xxv § 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">7. σφηκιάς] He does not seem
to refer again to the heathen; it is
the heretics themselves who swarm
out against the faith,—the same who
are described in the next sentence as
διαλ. ἀνάδοσιν.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. σχεδιάζεις] The verb denotes
what is hastily prepared out of the
first materials that come to hand,
‘to improvise.’ It thus returns to
the accusation that Gr.’s opponents
had had no proper training.</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. δ. ἀνάδοσιν] Ἀναδίδωμι is to
‘yield,’ as the earth yields a crop, or
the spring a volume of water. Thuc.
iii 88 uses it of Aetna, πῦρ κ. καπνὸν
ἀναδ. So ἀνάδοσις is an ‘output’ or
‘outburst.’ Διαλεκτικῶν of course is
masc., ‘dialecticians.’</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. οἱ μ....τ. γίγαντας] Α contracted expression; ‘as the old fables did with the giants,’ meaning, ‘as the old fables said that the Earth brought forth the giants.’ It the metaphor of ἀνάδοσιν.

“According to later accounts, the
Pythagoreans of the higher grade
[lived] in obedience to a minutely
prescribed rule of life... This... enjoined
. . . entire abstinence from . . .
animal food, from beans and some
other kinds of nourishment.’’
op. cit. p. 343 f. “Whether
ordinances," he adds, "originated
with the Italian Pythagoreans, or
only belong to the later Orphics of
Pythagorean tendencies; whether
consequently they arose from Pythagoreanism
or from the Orphic
mysteries, we do not certainly know."
Zeller speaks of ‘the early connexion
of Pythagoreanism with the Bacchic
Orphic mysteries" (p. 347, first
note).</note>
<note type="footnote">ib. Αὐτὸς ἔφα] “ They rigorously
maintained the doctrine of their
master, and silenced all pposition
with the famous dictum αὐτὸς ἔφα”:
Zeller p. 350. Gr. calls this κ. ἀλαζ.
‘an extraordinary piece of swagger.’</note>

the Idea as that which is common
to the Many of like name...This
Universal he conceives as separate
from the world of Phenomena, —as
absolutely existing Substance...The
Ideas stand as the eternal prototypes
of Being —all other things are copied
from them"; "archetypes, according
to which Divine Reason fashioned
the world ”: Zeller Plato and the
Older Academy pp. 239 foil., 244.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. μετενσωματώσεις κ. περιόδους]
‘his tran sincorporations and circulations
of our souls.’ See Zeller
cit. ch. ix. “At their first birth, all
[souls]...are implanted in human,
and male, bodies; only their lots
vary according to their merit. After
death, all are judged, and placed for
a thousand years, some as a punishment
under the earth, some as a
reward in heaven. This period
having elapsed, they have again to
choose,—the evil as well as the
—a new kind of life; and in this
choice, human souls pass into beasts,
or from beasts back into human
bodies’’ (p. 393).</note>
<note type="footnote">4. ἀναμνήσεις] Plato taught that
our souls bring with them into their
earthly existence knowledge acquired
in a previous state of existence. “If
...concepts and cognitions [of an
universal kind] are given us before
any presentation has been appropriated,
we cannot have acquired them
in this life, but must have brought
them with us from a previous life.
The facts of learning and of conceptual
knowledge are only to be
explained by the pre-existence of
the soul. ” Zeller p. 395.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. ἐπὶ ψυχήν] ‘directed to,’
as far as,’ and so ‘ concerned
the soul,’ i.e. of the beloved,
it may profess to be unconcerned with
the body. "Love...is realised in a
graduated series of different forms.
The first is the love of beautiful
shapes,—of one, and then of all:
higher step is the love of beautiful
souls, which operates in moral words
and efforts, in works of education,
art, and legislation: a third is the
love of beautiful sciences," etc.:

of Epicurus was of a practical,

<note type="footnote">3. τὰ σά] It is difficult to see
why the subjects which Gr. classes
under this head should be so described
anymore than many of the foregoing.
It does not seem to mean ’Christian
’ rather than heathen; which
would more naturally have been
called τὰ ἡμέτερα; and besides, such
a subject as ὕλη has nothing distincteively
Christian in it. Prob. Gr.
means ’stick to a line of your own,’
as distinguished from being guided
by the movements of an adversary.</note>

Elias rightly understands Gr. to
mean good and bad angels.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ἐπιτυγχ...διαμαρτ.] ’to ’
’to miss,’ It certainly seems
that Gr. should consider it almost
a matter of inifference whether a
man were right or wrong upon such
matters as the last four which he has
mentioned. But this is evidently
the sense which is required. Prob.
he supposed that it was not possible
to go far wrong on such subjects.
Any interpretation of ’recompense,’
for instance, which was not really
a denial of recompense, would be
harmless in comparison with the
teaching upon the nature of Christ
to which Gr. was accustomed from
the Eunomians.</note>

often used in the plur. in this adverbial
sense. It appears to suggest
the various occasions on which a
little of such intercourse is vouchsafed.
In the contrasted clause,
μικρὸν qualifies ὕστερον, and ἴσως
qualifies τελεώτ., ’soon after,’
more perfectly,’ ’—the ἴσως suggesting
a modest doubt concerning
our share in the great revelation.</note></p>

by the greatness of the
revelation. The glories of the Divine
Nature are tempered for us, as it
were, by the Human Life which
encompasses us as we look out from
it to the Divine. By the Incarnation,
our field of contemplation is at once
restricted and made clear.</note>

But it is harsh to supply the necessary

which will accord better with grammatical
requirements. In ἑ 12 Gr.

accordingly, we must suppose, that
it is Gr. himself, and not the λίαν
ἀγνώμων, who denies εἶναι θεὸν ὅπερ
ἔφαντ’. It is, he says, very unreasonable
not to accept the natural proofs
of God's existence, and in following
them we are compelled to form certain
great outlines of a conception
of God (e.g. creative power, rational
method, etc.), which we cannot
doubt to be correct. But even this
is not the same thing as to identify
εἶναι ὅπερ) God with what we have
imagined, or figured to ourselves,
or what our reason has delineated.
τοῦτο is the subject of ἐστὶν understood,
of which εἶναι θ. κτλ. is the
predicate. While we have ἀποδείξεις
for the one belief, we have none
for the other.</note>

Almost each word here requires annotation.
Λόγος is ‘the σῶμα,’
or perhaps ἀσώματον σῶμα Φορὰν
at first sight seems to refer to τὴν
κύκλῳ φ. just above; but there is
prob. no such play upon the word
intended. Gr. seems to employ it
in the sense of ‘usage.’ Although
no other example of the subst. in
that sense is at hand, the verb is not
infrequently so used. Gr. has διὰ
γλώσσης φέρειν ‘to speak of.
Ἀναπλάττειν and its derivatives are
frequent in Gr. Sometimes the prep.
has its full force, ‘re-construction,’
‘fashioning afresh,’ as for ex.
baptism; sometimes it is simply ‘to
fashion,’ ‘imagine.’ Thus he
of matter ὕλην) as ὑποστᾶσαν ἐξ οὐκ
ὄντων, κἄν τινες ἀγέννητον ἀναπλάττωσιν.
So here he seems to mean
the ‘shaping’ which the Aristotelians
put upon the word, with a slight
suggestion of its being a factitious
and not the legitimate construction.
This is further expressed by calling
it αὐτόνομον, ‘their inderpendent,’
arbitrary, ‘use and construction of
the word.’</note>

is characterized by Gr. himself (in
§ 11) as σκολιὸν γριφοειδές. Editors,
therefore, and translators may
be excused if they have made nonsense
of it by wrong punctuation
and by impossible renderings. The
drift, however, is plain enough. Gr.
places his opponent in a dilemma.
If the Divine Being is located in a
section of the universe, it is circumscribed
by something relatively small
τοῦ τινός=the supposed section,
ἐλάττονος in comparison with τὸ
πᾶν); a notion which is manifestly
absurd. If on the other hand it is
located in the universe at large, yet
still (ex hypothesi) within the universe,
then, though the thing which
circumscribes it is relatively great
πλ. καὶ ἄλλου πολλοῦ=‘greater than
other great things’), yet none
less it is as much circumscribed as
in the former case. This follows
from the very statement that τὸ θεῖον
is ‘in’ the universe, which at once
involves the relation of the thing
containing to the thing contpined
(grammatically τὸ περιεχόμενον is in
apposition to the subject of περιγραφήσεται,
and τοῦ περιέχοντος to
ἐλάττονος τοῦ τινός and to πλείονος
respectively). To complete the argument,
however, it is necessary to
postulate εἰ...μέλλοι) that the universe
is not positively infinite but
contained within itself if within nothing
else, and that as it consists of
space-relations it cannot he exempt
from the possibility of circumscription.
(The grammar of the last
clause is apparently irregular, and
some word like χρὴ must be supplied
from μέλλοι; but it is possible that
Gr. intends μέλλοι to stand absolutely
and impersonally in both clauses
(=‘it is to be a ’), making τό
πᾶν περισχ. ace. and inf., like μ.
τόπον εἶναι).</note>

is the common form so constant
while appearing with such a variety
of distinguishing features; and in
all that variety the peculiarities of
each individual remain untouched,
so that no two men are exactly
alike?</note>
<note type="footnote">11. τὸ αὐτὸ ζῶον] ‘animal’ for
‘kind of animal’; as we talk of
’the ’ ’the ’ Gr. is speaking
of the deathless persistence of the

of the specimen. His wonder is
that the type endures. It never
passes into another ζῶον. Μετα-
στάσει, ‘removal’ by death.</note>

mean the flow or current of the river.
Suidas gives an interpretation ὁδὸς
ἢ ἀγωγὸς ῥεύματος, and quotes the
phrase rbv ὁλκὸν τοῦ ὕδατος ἔκοψεν.
Here then it would mean ‘as in the
channel of a river, which (river)
never stands still, yet is ever there.’
This is in accordance with the
common meaning of ὁ. = sulcus.</note>

or that some Stoic writer so applied

by the violence with which it is

theory. It is not in Arist. Meteor.

much to say about underground
currents of wind, as well as of underground
streams. Arist. rightly connects
hot springs with volcanic action.

so says τὸ ἐν and not rbv ἔνα. Α

the divine being are represented to
us as hypostatic — notably the Λόγος

this primary faculty, antecedent and
necessary to the production of the
Son, is hypostatic also. If that is
the case, He does not owe His

partly also to the ’s Will,

justice.</note>
<note type="footnote">15. ἕτερον οἷμαι] Gr.'s argument
is not very clear; because the Eunomians
also had distinguished very

they said that the Son could not be
the Son of one who willed to beget
Him, but only of that will itself.
But in so arguing they set up
a new, though fictitious, identity.
They converted the will itself into
a personal agency. This is what
Gr. combats. Will is one thing,
and the person who wills is another.
You might as well say that the
thing begotten is the son of beget-
ting, or trace the thing spoken to
speaking instead of the speaker, as
thus erect will into a substantive

is using ἕπεται in its logical sense.
He does not mean that in the order
of facts the act of will sometimes

the will.</note>

God comes to be God. If by His

one portion of His being the result of

not in this case as much a child of
will as the Son? If He is God
without willing to be so, then He is
under compulsion.</note>

If τὸ ἀγέννητον constitutes

similar case can be made out for
these other predicates. Then, since
the divine nature is absolutely identified
with τὸ ἀγέννητον, and yet

we are driven to suppose that these
are separate natures, or essences, or
that they compose the divine nature
by their aggregation.</note>
<note type="footnote">11. Assume for the sake of argument
that to be unbegotten belongs
to God alone, though the assertion
would by some be denied. It does
not follow that unbegottenness is a
necessary part of the divine essence.
Adam alone was directly fashioned
by God; yet Seth is as truly man
as Adam. The divine essence is a
positive, not α negative thing. If
you ask me what it is, I can
answer that I hope we may know
some day, but not here. Meanwhile,
whatever glory there is in the underived
existence belongs to the Son

the nature of the begotten Son is not

<note type="footnote">1. τινῶν ὁ θεός] ’God,’ acc. to
Gr., is a relative term; a ’ God ’
must be ’God of’ some one. If
then unbegottenness is the very
essence of God, and ‘unbegotten’
and ‘God’ are convertible terms,
then we must be able to say with
equal correctness, ’ the God of all ’
and ‘the unbegotten of all’; or
conversely, as the unbegotten is ’no
one's unbegotten,’ so God must be
‘no one's God.‘ The argument
does not seem a very valuable one,
because, to begin with, it must be
questioned whether ‘God’ is really
a term of relationship. If it be
so, then apart from creation God
would not be God. But the main
purpose of the argument is sound,
inasmuch as it shews the absurdity
of identifying absolutely the positive
existence of God with a merely
negative description. On Gr. ’s interprettation
of the word θεός, see iv
18.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. ὁμοίως ἐκφέρεται] True synonyms
are used interchangeably (lit.
’are produced, employed, in a similar
manner’); cp. προφέρεται in § 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. ἀνάγκη] If ἀγέννητον is the
very nature of God, and yet God
begets a Son (which the Eunomians
in a sense allow), it follows that the
nature of the Son is not only different
from that of the Father, but
is diametrically opposite to it. This
is not allowed by any one οὐ δέδοται).</note>
<note type="footnote">9. αἱ ἔξεις τῶν ’στ’. πρότεραι] You
cannot take away a thing which is
not there to begin with. But ἀγέννητον
implies a taking away of γέννεννητάν.
Therefore γέννητον is prior
to ἀγέννητον, — the Son to the Father,
— and when the Father comes,
and His ἀγέννητον is alone recongised
as divine, He does away
with the Son who occupied the
ground before Him. Of course this
argument is one of mere mockery
ἐρεσχελία, i 3).</note>
<note type="footnote">13. ’If the begetting of the Son
is not a thing finished ἀν’ ’done with,
it is as yet incomplete, and will one
day be completed: if it is finished, it
must have begun.’ That does not
follow. ἱν soul had a beginning,
but will never have an end.</note>
<note type="footnote">No; our belief is, that whatever
possesses the essential notes of a class
of beings — say of α horse or an ox —
is rightly called by that name, whatever
distinctive properties it may
have which mark it off from others
of the class. So it ἲς with God; the
nature is one, although there are
differences of designation, corresponding
to differences hi fact, between the
Persons who share that natitre.</note>

introduced by copyists who
thought that Gr. was making a
statement of his own belief, which
was that the name θεός is applied in
precisely the same sense to Father
and Son. But this ignores Gr.'s
argument, — and, it may he added,
the meaning of ὁμωνυμία. Gr.'s
immediate purpose is to shew that
the Eunomian illustration is, from
their own point of view, ill-chosen.
To be of any service to them, their
instance of ’equivocation’ should
have been one where the same name
is applied to two objects of very
different value.</note>

argument, Gr. annoers, lies in this,
—that they attribute to the underlying
essence what is predicated of
the particular possessor of that essence.
It is like arguing that because so and
so is a dead man, therefore man is
dead.</note>

<note type="footnote">1. συνάγωσιν] ‘conclude.’ The
Eunomian syllogism is this: ’The
Father is greater than the Son inasmuch
as the Son owes His existence
to Him. But the giving of existence
to the Son belongs to the Father by
nature. Therefore the Father is
greater than the Son by nature.’</note>
<note type="footnote">3. οὐ γὰρ ἁπλῶς κτλ.] The
reply is that not everything which
is predicated of a particular thing
(e.g. of Socrates) is predicated of the
nature which underlies that thing
(in the example chosen, human nature).
Everyone recognises what
the statements are intended to
apply to, and how they apply. So,
what we say of the Father does not
necessarily apply to the Divine
Essence which belongs to Him;
some things apply to Him as Father,
not as God.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. κατὰ τίνος, καὶ τίνα] The
words are interrogative; if Gr. had
intended the indef. pron., he must
have said δ. ὅτι κ. τ. It seems
necessary to understand κατὰ again
before τίνα, ’in regard to what
’ — i.e. in regard to nature, or
to individuality, or what. To take
the example given by Gr. at the end
of the section, if I say that Socrates
is a dead man, it is plain that I am
speaking of Socrates in particular
and of no one else, and that I am
speaking of Socrates in relation to
the bodily life, not about his soul,
nor about his influence.</note>
<note type="footnote">5. τί κωλύει κἀμέ] Two can play
at that game, Gr. says. He too can
draw that kind of conclusion, and
they shall see whether it will hold.
He makes a major premiss of that
conclusion of theirs, ’The father is
by nature greater than the ’
(We need not suppose that Gr. is
for the moment speaking of God:
the words would suit any father and
son.) The minor premiss is, ’But
he is not by nature necessarily greater,
or necessarily ’ So far there
is no absurdity. He need never have
had a son; there might have been
nothing else to compare him with.
(Gr., 1 repeat, is not speaking of
God.) The right conclusion would
be that the ’s ’natural’ superiority
over his son consists solely in
his fatherhood, and not in his nature,
—in his relationship, and not
in that which he is when considered
apart by himself. But the false conclusion
which Gr. draws, to illustrate
the false conclusions of the
Eunomians, is this: ’Therefore the
greater is not necessarily greater, ’ or
‘The father is not necessarily father.’
It will be observed that Gr. says
μεῖζον, not 6 μείζων, which makes it
clearer that the proposition is intended
to be quite general: Ἁ thing
which is greater than another need
not be greater, but might be at the
same time equal or less; a father
need not be his ’s father, but
might be his brother or his son.’
The second paralogism ὁ θεὸς οὐ
πάντως θεός) helps to shew that this
is Gr.'s meaning.</note>

of course, is on ὁ δεῖνα, and it
seems simplest to take ἄνθρ. along

νεκρός alone to be predicate — an
arrangement of words like ὁ μέγας
τέθνηκε Βασίλειος. But the sense is
the Same either way. In the apodosis,

being supplied from the previous

commentators from Elias onwards
have totally failed to catch the argument,
or even to understand the
grammar of the passage. If Gr. had
intended to say anything so pointless
as Petavius (de Trin. II v 12)
makes out, viz. that because ὁ δεῖνα

in the sense of ’the composite
whole,’ consisting of Godhead and
manhood. It would, of course,
have been more exact to have said
τῆ διὰ σὲ κενώσει, or something of
that kind; but it would have been
less vivid; and there was no fear of
any one supposing that Gr. meant by

Him who had the κρείττω φύσιν.</note>

<note type="footnote">1. γενόμενος Ἴ’., ὁ κάτω θεός]
‘was made man, the earthly God.’
Gr. is fond of dwelling upon the
intrinsic divinity of man. Cp. Or.
xxxviii 7 ἵνα...ὡς οἰκείοις ἤδη προσομιλῇ
. . . θεὸς ἑνούμενός τε καὶ

<note type="footnote">2. συνανεκράθη θεῶ Cp. iv 2
ἐχρίσθη θεότητι; iv 3 θεῷ πλακῆναι
καἰ γεμέσθαι θεὸν ἐκ τῆς μίξεως. The
language, if pressed, would imply
that Christ was a human person,
taken into union with a divine one.
This would, of course, be erroneous,
and Gr. 's own words immediately
before shew that he perfectly understood
the Person of our Lord to be
divine first, and then by condescension
human. Prob. the nom. to
συνανεκράθη is strictly supplied from
ἄνθρωπος, ὁ κ. θεός, not from ὁ νῦν σοι
καταφρονούμενος. The humanity of
Christ undoubtedly συνανεκρ. θεῷ.
Put the humanity of Christ, impersonal
except by virtue of His assumption
of it, is not exactly described
by the term ἄνθρωπος. The
rise of Nestorianism, which was
after Gr.'s time, would have suggesed
more careful phraseology;
and it may be added that a fear of
the still later Eutychianism might
have made Gr. modify the words
συνανεκράθη and τοῦ κρείττονος ἐκνικησαντος.</note>
<note type="footnote">3. ἵνα γένωμαι] It is perh. somewhat
νεανικόν to speak of our becoming
Gods ‘to the same extent’

would explain that he spoke of men

perh., in view of what follows,
τοσοῦτον means ’as truly.’ He
uses the same phrase in Or. xl

prob. refers to Basil, who, in the Hom.
in Princ. Proverb. ἑ 3, where he has
no controversial animus, expounds
very strikingly the ’personification’
of that wisdom which speaks to us
out of nature. Very likely other
Catholic authors adopted the same
view. Bas. himself, however,
when in controversy with the Eunomians,
gives the same account as
Gr. does here (adv. Enn. iv p. 293
Ληπτέον οὖν . . . ἐπὶ τοῦ τὴν μορφὴν
δούλου λαβόντος). That account, it
may be added, is derived from
Athanasius, who says (de Deer. Nic.
Syn. p. 220 B), To δὲ πρόσωπον τοῦ
μὲν σωτῆρός ἐστι, τότε δὲ λέγεται ὅτε
λοιπὸν λαβὼν τὸ σῶμα λέγει κτλ. Cp.
the fuller passage in Ath. Or. ii c.
Ar. ἑ 44 f.; also Eus. adv. Marcell.
ii 3. Among other expositors whom
Gr. knew, Origen (de Princ. i 2)
identifies Wisdom with the eternal
Son, and, though he does not admit
any imaginable period before the
generation of Wisdom, thinks that
Wisdom speaks of herself as having
been created, inasmuch as she comtains
in herself from the outset the
beginnings and outlines of the creation
that was to be. Denys of Rome
on the other hand (in Ath. de Deer.
Nic. Syn. Ρ. 232) dwells upon the
various significations of the word
κτίζειν in the Bible, and understands
it here to mean ’appointing,’ ‘setting
over the works which were
made through ’ For another
explanation, with which, however,
Gr. was hardly likely to be acquinted,
see nil. de Trin. xii 35

From what follows, it seems that Gr.

<note type="footnote">8. ἐδοὑλ. σαρκί] Gr. seems to
be undecided whether to take πολ.
λοῖς as neut., including σάρξ, λένεσις,
πάθη, or as masc, viz. πᾶσιν
οἶς κτλ. The ’Attic attraction’
οἶς misled De Billy into supposing
that πᾶσιν likewise was neut. (omnibus
illis per quae). It is difficult to
determine whether the same mistake
caused the copyists to write κατεχομένους,
or whether Gr. himself
neglected to complete the attraction
by saying (as he should have done)
κατεχομένοις. That Ue ’s translation
is wrong is shewn by the
absence of the article before κατεχομένους;
if Gr. had meant ’and all
those things whereby He hath saved
those who were enslaved,’ he
have said τοὺς κάτεχ’. In view of
the preponderating authority for
κατεχομένους, it seems best to retain
it in the text, understanding it to be
a construction ad sensum, agreeing
with the οὓς which lies hidden in
the attracted ὄις.</note>

The difference is that in the earlier

states the converse truth, that Christ

enters into our experiences in order

is unsatisfactory, so far as
συγχωρ. is concerned. It is best to
read ποσόν, and to make ἀπαιτ.,
συγχωρ., independent verbs coordinate

express the result of ’s gracious

that it is not only in respect of

the Son is said to make or do ‘like

Here the point seems to lie not

with regard to transient things like
thunder and wind, such words as
στερεοῦν, κτίζειν (to found). The
explanation is that the ‘law’ or
‘principle’ of them (λόγος) was laid
down once for all, though the activity
which produces them
continues.</note>

for the human will does not
always find it easy to conform to
the divine. The cry in Gethsemane
is a proof of it. But as it was only
the divine nature which came down ,
the will cannot be the human will.
Well, sentences of this kind do not
always imply the existence of the
thing whose activity is denied, but
quite the opposite. The Son has no
will of His own to do, apart from
the Father’s.</note>

τὸ κοινόν immediately before. With
the possible exception of the first,
they have nothing to do with the
peculiar ‘ community ’ which exists
between the Father and the Son.
We must therefore suppose that ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ is an adverbial expression
with a wider meaning. It is, however,
difficult to seize the exact
force of it. Elias appears to have
thought that it meant ’ in α way
that common intelligence discerns.'
It prob. means ’in a general way,'

<note type="footnote">1. καἰ οὐ θετικῶς] This is added
to bear out the assertion οὐχ ὡς
ὄντος, ἀλλ’ ὡς οὐκ ὄντος. The point
lies in this, that while the sentence,
rigidly analysed, implies the existence
of a fact, though it rejects an
inference drawn from the fact, the
speaker’s intention is to deny the
fact as well as the inference. Thus
οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου κτλ. implies that
the Spirit is ‘given,’ though not
‘by by measure ’ ; but in reality it
does not affirm the giving, any
more than the measuring. Again,
οὔτε ἢ ἁμαρτία μου κτλ. implies
that the Psalmist was guilty of sin,
though that guilt was not the cause
of the opposition which he en-
countered ; but the Psalmist has no
intention of affirming his own sin.
Again, οὐ διὰ τὰς δίκ’. ἤμ’. implies
that we have righteousnesses, though
we claim nothing on the ground of
them ; but St Paul would never
admit that we have any. Similarly,
’not Mine own will, but Thine’
implies the existence of a will of the
Son, apart from the ’s ; but
if we consider the expression ἀπὸ
κοινοῦ, in a broad way, in view of
the common use of language, we see
that no assertion of the kind is
intended.</note>

Elias takes it. But it might be
possible to take τὸ φ. = ‘ the look ’
of the saying, and τὸ νοούμ. = ‘ the

human nature, not to the divine.'
Ἄσχετον is used in a remarkable
way, as if from σχέσις, ‘ ’
In the light of later criticism, the
fact which Gr. notices may be
thought to tell in the opp. direction
: the absolute title seems to
denote the eternal relation, not the
temporary condition. See ’s
note in his St Mark p. 297. Gr. takes
the argument, as well as the illustrations
of τεῖχος, νύξ, from Ath. οἱ. iii
c. Ar. § 43, who says that if it had
stood ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ, it would have

and a nature is a thing
dependent upon connexion with something
else.' Gr. does not in these
words mean to describe a property
which distinguishes the divine nature
from others. It is a common
property of all natures. ‘Man,’ for
ex., is not the name of a relationship,
but of a substantive thing ;
while ’husband,’ ’slave,’ 'Cappadocian, ’

are not the names of a nature.</note>

What we are in quest of, we find in
the name ὁ ὤν ; for τὸ ὂν is the
special property of God, and belongs
to Him in its entirety, not partially,
as it does to other beings, who only
have a share in existence. It is a
little surprising that Gr. does not
say τὸ δὲ εἶναι, instead of τὸ δὲ ὄν.
Perhaps it is because he has used τὸ
εἶναι immediately before in a somewhat
different sense (viz. of what a
thing is, rather than that it is) ; and
whereas τὸ εἶναι represents existence
as a purely conceptual thing, τὸ ὂν
represents it as actually existing,
and so is better suited to denote the
fulness of the divine nature.</note>

to take χθ. κ. σῆμ’ closely together,
in the sense of ’recently ,' ’during

like πρώην τε καἰ χθές, excluding the
present, but including it. With σωματικῶς
cp. Col. ii 9; the adverbs
have no verbs to qualify, unless ὤν
or ὑπάρχων be supplied. For πνευματικῶς
= νοουμένας see WestCOtt on
Heb. ix 14. The sentence is therefore:
’Jesus, anointed with the whole

One — an undivided unit — in their

observation removes the Sabellian
conception of the unity ; the former
removes the Eunomian division of
the natures. In the construction of
the last clause, τῆς π. ν. διαιρέσεως
is the predicate after ἦ understood,
like οὐκ ἐλλείψεως above.</note>
<note type="footnote">10 You are surprised at our

which it might help you
to consider.</note>
<note type="footnote">12. δὸς οὖν μοι] The word διδόναι
is not used here in its frequent
sense of a logical concession ; for it
would be no concession to the
Eunomians to ’give’ what is here
required. It means rather, ’shew
me’ ‘convince me that it is so.’ The
Eunomian offers, if convinced that
two consubstantial persons issue from
the same Divine Source, to acknow-
ledge each of them to be a God.
Gr. illustrates the illogical character
of the offer by a counter-paralogism.
‘Shew me,’ he says, ‘that there is
than one sort of God, and I
will shew you the same Trinity that
we now believe in, name and thing.’
It is as unreasonable to deduce
ditheism or tritheism from the
Catholic doctrine of the relation of
the Son and Spirit to the Father, as
it would be to deduce the Catholic
doctrine of the Trinity from a belief
in Godheads of varying quality.</note>

<note type="footnote">1. τὸ προσκ. τῷ πν] Gr. thinks
that ‘worshipping or praying in or
by the Spirit,’ which are clearly
commanded, are in fact the bringing
of prayer and worship by the Spirit
to Himself. This is based upon the
text first quoted, in which the object
of the worship πνεῦμά ἐστιν. Not
that Gr. definitely takes the first
πνεῦμα in that text to be the Holy
Ghost ; but on the principle that
worship offered to one person of the
Trinity is offered to all, his reasoning
is correct, if his premisses are
accepted. It must be owned, however,
that he somewhat begs the
question.</note>

he means cases where the noun is
expressed and the numeral agrees
with it (oἷς i.e. συναριθμουμένοις
practically = ‘ the numeral’), like
‘three men,’ ‘three God.’ He does
not mean that you can never lump

the First Cause to the lowest. The

<note type="footnote">7. ἢ διαγράψομεν] Cp. iii 8. The
words ἢ ἀθετήσομεν, ἐπειδὴ οὐ γέγραπται
seem to be an ancient gloss
to explain ἢ διαγράψομεν. They
offer no real alternative to it ; and
the variation of the mss. which contain
them between ἢ and καὶ ἢ indicates
the uncertainty of their footing.
If they are to be retained, the only
sense that can be got out of them
would be this: — Shew us the words
ἀγέννητον, ἄναρχον in the Bible, and
we will either reject the Holy
Ghost’s Divinity for not being found
there, or (if we can prove that it is
there) we will erase both it and your
two words together. But this would
be very cumbrous. Omitting the
words, the sense is plain. Gr. retaliates
; — Shew us ἀγένν., ἄναρχ. in
the Bible, or we will discard them,
and you will die by your own rules.
The perf. τέθνηκας gives vividness
to the argument. Probably the
gloss was introduced because Gr. ’s
word διαγράψομεν seemed itself to
imply that the words ἀγέννητον etc.
were to be found written in Scripture.
How can that be erased which
was never written? The scribe
wished to substitute for διαγρ. the
more general word ἀθετήσομεν, ‘because
the expressions in question
are not written.’ It may be
that the correction might be
due to Gr. himself; but (1) its place
in the MSS. is against it; it ought to
have followed διαγρ.; (2) by διαγρ.
Gr. intended no reference to being
found in Scripture ; he meant, if
conscious of the metaphor at all, an
erasure from the theological writings
in which the expressions occurred.</note>

pure, and most subtle spirits’ in
Wisd. ‘through’ which the Spirit
‘goes,’ are, in Gr.’s opinion (no
doubt correct), not only ‘the angelic
Powers,’ but also the spirits of prophets
and apostles. These the Holy
Spirit penetrates κατὰ ταὐτό, ‘simultabeously,’
although they are distributed
in many different places, which
is a proof that He is infinite.</note>
<note type="footnote">30. Such sayings involve His

<note type="footnote">9. οἶον ἄλλον θ.] The words have

is equivalent to calling Him God.</note>

what is called ὀπή in James iii 11, —
the ‘mouth’ out of which the spring
issues. No other example of this
usage seems to be known; but Gr.’s
own language in his poem about
the Holy Ghost (iii 60) leaves no
room for doubt. He there rejects
the same comparison of πόρος, πηγή,
ποταμὸς μέγας, ἐν τε ῥέεθρον. It is
just possible that Gr. was aware
that an ‘eye’ is the ordinary word
in Hebrew for a spring; but in any
case the metaphor is so natural that
it is prob. an accident that we do
not find it oftener.</note>

between the su itself and the ray

sun. Cp. Or. xliv 4. And secondly
there was the opposite danger of
suggesting that the Father alone has
true positive being, while the Son
and Spirit are but faculties of His,
without personal subsistence, such
being in Gr.’s view the character
the ray and the light.</note>

<note type="footnote">3. ἄλλος ἥλιος] This, ace. to Gr.,
would be necessary to make the
illustration complete. Cp. § 14, and
§ 30 ἄλλον θεόν. The ray is not the
equal of the luminous body which
gives it off; whereas in the Trinity
there is, as it were, a sun giving off
a sun.</note>
<note type="footnote">4. ἡλιακαί τ. ἀπόρρ.] ‘solar
effluences’; Gr. will not even
ἡλίου ἀπόρρ., because it might suggest
that, once flowing forth, the
effluence has some kind of independent
existence, whereas his point
is that the ray and the light are but
properties of the sun. This is further
brought out by the addition
καὶ ποιότ. οὖσ’. ‘and essential qualities.’
By οὐσιώδεις Gr. seems from
the context to mean ’belonging to the
nature of the sun.’ Elsewhere,
the word is used in a way that
would give an almost opposite
meaning ; e.g. Or. xli 11 οὐκέτι ἐνεργείᾳ
παρὸν ὡς πρότερον, οὐσιωδῶς δέ,
ὡς ἂν εἴποι τις, συγγινόμενον ; Cyr.
Hier. Cat. Myst. iii 1 πνεύματος
ἁγίου οὐσιώδης ἐπιφοίτησις. Ace. to
these examples, ποιότητες οὐσιώδεις
would rather mean ‘real, substantive
qualities.’ In order to suit
context, we should then have to
understand οὐσιώδεις to have something
of a concessive force, ‘qualities
after all, however real and
substantive.’</note>
<note type="footnote">5. καὶ ἄμα τὸ εἶναι κτλ.] The
gloss μόνῳ τῷ πατρί gives the right
direction for understanding the passage:
it means that if we are content
with the illustration, we attribute τὸ
εἶναι only to the Father, and withhold
it from the Son and Spirit.
Ἐν τούτοις = in the Persons so conceived
of. Thus to ‘God’ (in the
sense of ὅλος θεός iv 6) we should
‘attribute at the same time existence
and non-existence.’</note>
<note type="footnote">7. ἤκουσα δέ τινος] ‘I once heard
a man offering the following
It is unknown who the
man was.</note>
<note type="footnote">8. μαρμαρυγήν τινα] The illustration,
tration, though attractive to the
poetical imagination of Gr., is not
immediately clear. It seems at first
as if the trinity were the sunbeam,
the water, and the wall, which
combine to produce the παλμός, the
dancing and quivering reflexion.
The point, however, appears to lie
rather in the junction of unity with
multiplicity (the number three being
for the moment lost sight of) displayed
in the vibrations of the
sunbeam.</note>
